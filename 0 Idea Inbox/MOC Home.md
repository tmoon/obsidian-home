## 📚 How to Use MOCs

**What is a MOC?**
A Map of Content is a note that links to other notes on a related topic. It's like a curated index or table of contents for a theme.

**When to create a MOC:**
- You have 10+ notes on a related topic
- You keep searching for the same type of content
- You want to see connections across different sources

**How to maintain MOCs:**
- Use Dataview queries to auto-populate links
- Review during monthly review
- Add new notes by tagging them appropriately
- Keep the structure simple and scannable
