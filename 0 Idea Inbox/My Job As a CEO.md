	1. Do we get more users?
	2. Do we validate / invalidate hypothesis?
	3. Does it help us move faster / deliver at a better pace so that we can keep our customers satisfied?
2. How do we [[build something that the people want]]? [[People only buy things that meet their subconscious need]]
3. Does it help us to raise the next round?
4. Does it keep the lights on? (necessary evil OPS, generally has no correlation w/ success--keep these kind of tasks minimal, find ways to automate out)
