# Idea Inbox - Strategic Capture & High-Level Thinking

> **Function:** Your command center for strategic thinking and quick capture before processing.

---

## What Lives Here

**Braindump Inbox** → Your ONLY capture point
- Dump everything here immediately - no organization
- Process to zero every Sunday (weekly review)
- Think of it as your external RAM

**Dashboard** → Read-only task overview
- Auto-aggregates all project tasks
- Single pane of glass for your landscape
- View only - never add tasks here directly

**MOC Home** → Knowledge navigation hub
- Links to all Maps of Content
- Find notes by theme, not location
- Your Second Brain's table of contents

**Strategic Documents** → Big-picture thinking
- CEO framework notes
- Life pillars and vision
- System methodology

## Rules

**Capture:**
- Everything goes to Braindump Inbox first
- No exceptions - if it's in your head, get it out
- Don't organize during capture

**Process:**
- Only during weekly review (Sunday 30min)
- Apply decision framework: <2min? Project? Area? Resource? Someday? Delete?
- Goal: Braindump at zero after every review

**Never:**
- Don't let Braindump grow beyond 30 items
- Don't add tasks to Dashboard (it's auto-generated)
- Don't process inbox daily (batching is more efficient)

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**This folder is your mental inbox. It should be EMPTY or close to it after weekly review.**

If Braindump Inbox has >30 items, you're collecting not processing. Block 1 hour, apply 2-minute rule ruthlessly, and get back to zero.

The Dashboard shows you the whole landscape - use it to spot patterns:
- Same type of task repeating? Create a system
- Project with no progress? Archive or recommit
- Too many active projects? Ruthlessly prioritize 1-3

Strategic docs here should challenge you. If they don't, they're platitudes. World-class CEOs revisit vision monthly.

*Your capture system works when it's friction-free IN and ruthlessly processed OUT.*
