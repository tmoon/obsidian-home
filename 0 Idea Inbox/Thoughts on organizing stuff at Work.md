1. Need to ensure people are in flow stage executing one thing, towards one singular goal
2. Each task should be actionable and clear (smart goal) and have a clear timeline for execution
3. We should have a good visualization of what we are trying to get done 
4. Waiting on tasks at gtd simply are in progress tasks with clear timeline


### personal level
1. Always write things down, it will clutter mind if is there

3. It’s important to be in the flow

7. “Relaxed control” — gtd, also duck swimming metaphor 
8. The diagram of gtd is helpful to figure out the action ability of tasks 


### how to structure work
1. Every day in the morning review the active open items and move them to respective [[0 Current Tasks + Projects]] (add to old/new projects, next action list, stage them for doing immediately if takes under 2mins, delete/move them to someday list on notion)
2. Every evening have some time to do the “thousand cut” items
3. Have project files that encompass working projects (the tasks should be clustered there)
4. Create a page that shows open stuff by project / next action with data view
5. Think about any other clustering that I might need for open tasks
6. How do I deal with things in a project (or overall that I’m waiting for), maybe one list of waiting for is fine, I just add what I’m waiting for and link relevant project
7. A clear inventory for the list of project is invaluable 
8. Do a retro every night
