### Things to look into
1. GTD
2. Eisenhower Matrix 

### Notion Template for Task Management
1. ver: March 8, 24
2. The idea is that we still have our projects and inbox in Obsidian
3. Once we have enough tasks, we go through the [[3 Resource/Readwise/Articles/Getting Things Done|Getting Things Done]] + [[Eisenhower Matrix]] chart to first
	1. Clarify what we mean by each of them
	2. If not important and not urgent (in 2mins), either delete it, or put it on a seprate list of someday item, if you feel like this is something you want to do in the future Examples
		1. movies, shows, and books to get to 
		2. travel to some place / dine somewhere / ski somewhere 
	3. If it can be done under 2-4mins, get it done and don't spend any more energy trying to overprocess it
		1. if calendar item put it on calendar / schedule it
	4. Otherwise: put them on projects on NOTION (IMPORTANT: Create a project graveyard where dead / finished projects go to die)
4. Now let's get to doing stuff! Use pomodoro + break out each projects in sub tasks / prioratize / order them 
	1. P0 (urgent + important): breakdown and add it to your daily task list and get them done ASAP
	2. P1 (important + not urgent): put it on your daily task-list, albeit slightly below P0
	3. P2 (urgent + not important): Can you delegate? If not consider making a playbook and then delegate
	4. P3 (not urgent + not important): most likely, not doing it, unless all the above are done! so we should be doing these very infrequently, unless we reached a point where we are a ninja that finished everything!

### Task Categories
1. [[Pillars of Life as a Founder]]:
	1. Work
	2. Life
	3. Fun
2. Other:
	1. someday items

### Concrete Action Items 
1. Read GTD + other books, (shortform is fine)
2. Implement them in notion
	1. Is the current 3 level of importance and effort useful? might just remove those label
	2. consider importance to: important and not important
	3. consider updating effort to: < hour, few hours, few days, unknown (or long)
		1. The idea here is to make sure we just process the shorter tasks (minutes) immediately from the braindump inbox
		2. and if it is unknown, scope it to something more manageable (maybe it is just a project instead?)
