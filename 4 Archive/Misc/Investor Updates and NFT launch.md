Write a short, concise investor update with the points above

Dear Investors,

We are excited to provide you with some important updates on our latest developments at Affine. We have been heads-down running experiments to learn our users' pain points--we want to stay relevant even in this tough macro condition. So, we are excited to announce that we will be launching Affine Pass, a membership NFT collection  and we are currently experimenting with Alpine Empower, a global, USD and Tbill collateralized debit card aimed at global freelancers and workforce.

TL;DR:
1. Affine Pass NFT launch, need intros to projects and protocols
2. Seeing slow, but steady user adoption
3. Especially exciting is the LSD baskets
4. Launching Empower, a new USD/USDC/Tbill backed global business card
5. Major ask: Please make intro to relevant defi / web3 projects for the freemint and whitelist giveaway


6. Our main focus right now is the launch of Affine Pass, a new NFT collection that comes with utility and reward features. Our main focus right now is to partner with relevant web3 projects and give our membership NFTs to partner communities to excite people about us.

7. Since the launch of Affine last quarter, we have witnessed an overwhelming response from the community. Nearly 2,000 individuals have already deposited into our product, resulting in a total value locked (TVL) of approximately 2.2 million.

8. The liquid staking derivative (LSD) products have garnered significant interest from investors. In particular, we are able to provide 1.8-2x staking boost compared to Lido's return, which has been gaining traction among the users.

9. In addition to all these exciting developments, we are also preparing for the launch of Alpine Empower, a new card product specifically designed for the global workforce. This product aims to provide unique financial solutions tailored to meet the needs of business owners and freelancers worldwide. One of our major finding has been that it is very hard for people around the world to hold USD and get access to something as simple as Tbill derivative assets. We are aiming to solve this major problem with this new launch.

### Major Asks
1. Please make intros to relevant defi / web3 projects: As we decentralize and launch a token next year, we are launching the Affine Pass NFT collection (it will have various utilities, including fee discounts and extra rewards). We would love to collaborate with good web3 / defi projects and give out some membership NFTs to the partner community and partner team.
