### To Projects / Founders


Hey: How have you been? 

Hope you guys are well. As we decentralize and launch a token next year, we are launching the Affine Pass NFT collection (it will have various utilities, including fee discounts and extra rewards). We would love to collaborate with you guys and give out some membership NFTs to your community and your team.

Wondering if guys would be open to doing an AMA and marketing collab?


At Affine we are building cross chain defi yield automation primitives. We are backed by Jump, Hack VC, Coinbase, Circle, Shima among many others. We are currently using both Chainlink (for pricing feeds) and Wormhole for some of our cross chain messaging--would love to understand how we can work w/ chainlink for our message passing needs.
### To teams that barely knows us

At Affine we are building defi yield automation primitives and trying to build our community and collaborations. We are backed by Jump, Hack VC, Coinbase, Circle, Shima among many others (JD and Rahul are also investors)


As we decentralize and launch a token next year, we are launching the Affine OG NFT collection (it will have various utilities, including fee discounts and extra rewards). We would love to collaborate with you guys and give out some membership NFTs to your community and your team.
