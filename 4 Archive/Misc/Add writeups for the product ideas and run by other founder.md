- [x] Decide whether we can do a “trend analysis”? (25mins)
	- [ ] What are the main crypto trends right now?
	- [ ] Where are whales putting the most amount of money and why?
	- [ ] Where is retail putting money? (and why)
	- [ ] What problems are people having
- [ ] What are the product ideas?
    - [ ] Review and consolidate in 2-3 sentences
    - [ ] Main questions to ask:
        - [ ] why do people (esp whales) want it?
        - [ ] will future retail want it? is there enough narrative to support it?
        - [ ] does it connect to the “trend”?
- [ ]
