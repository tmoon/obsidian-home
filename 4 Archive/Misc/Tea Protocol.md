### Learn About Tea

https://tea.xyz/

1. Will create an open source package manager where the updates will be published to the chain that they have built?
2. That chain will have a token that will power the whole system

### Player in the Ecosystem
1. Users (potentially the largest number of players)
2. Testers (bounty hunters) and stakers (medium)
3. Developers (smaller number, but highest value)

Goals:
1. You want the max number of developers to use your ecosystem 
2. You want the network secured by a set of stakers (assuming doing specialized L1 w/ cosmos or something like that)
3. You want the token price to not go to zero given the emissions
4. allowing people to necessarily hold and investy 



Solutions:
1. for 1:  easy solution is early token emission to the graph
	1. Problem:
		1. How do you fairly allocate the tokens to the users
5. You want the network to be secured by the stakers--you can also give them yield for staking
6. You should probably create a separate staking mechanism for the testers (who will presumably earn a higher amount of yield for doing the work of the test and risking their capital if they are wrong)
	1. Another issue is that how do you enforce slashing? who makes the decision?
7. 


### Minefields
1. securities law
2. how to destroy supply OR ramp up demand despite continuous inflation print (e.g. other than earning yield what are the key use cases)
3. 

### How to create utility
1. 60% of inflationary token goes to the "graph", which attributes token to each "sub-DAO"
	1. Initially you can have much higher incentive, allowing 
2. Creating a network itself has value given the utility of the network
3. Voting rights can create interesting incentive (but can also allow very large players to be malicious)
