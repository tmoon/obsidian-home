Hi Jonathan:

Hope you are well. Wanted to give you some background about a new charge-card (smart debit card) product we are working on, and find a time to setup a call between us. When are you free this week? Tuesday and Wednesday are generally the best for us. Here is my calendly: https://calendly.com/tarik-m/affine-30

**Background:**

We are currently exploring a business model to offer credit card services to international clients who primarily transact in USD, namely freelancers, app store developers, and remote workers who often face challenges in obtaining such services in their local markets.

In our recent user study, we found that many of our current users are non-US individuals (and mostly business owners) and many of them are earning USD. Given many live in countries where USD is much stronger against their local currency (and often their local inflation is extremely high), they prefer to keep their money in US dollars. However, there isn't really a good path from them to do so given their local regulations. In addition, many cannot get banked by their local banks given they don't have local employment history (given they mostly work outsourcing).

Now, some have even gone as far as opening a US LLC or Singapore LTD to make sure they can do their banking. That said managing these structures can be extremely time and resource intensive--so it doesn't allow relatively smaller business owners (< $200K revenue) to setup such structure.

**Solution:**
Our proposed solution involves leveraging the amended Companies Law (2020 revision) in the Cayman Islands:

- Establishing a Cayman entity and issue one separate Segregated Portfolio Company for each our our clients
- KYCing and KYBing these clients and the SPC for our banking partners
- Issuing a debit card through these entities
- Using these entities solely as pass-through entities for the debit card process.
- Opening a financial wallet and issuing a credit card
- Considering a Banking-as-a-Service model, like the one provided by Unit or treasury prime, for process optimization
- Automating their tax filing and other year-end compliance requirements (if any)

However, we are uncertain about the corporate structuring and tax implications associated with such an operation. Hence, we seek your legal advice on:

- What are the setup process for these SPCs? In the US, for example, Wyoming series LLCs are extremely cheap and you just need to pay $10 to the state and you can simply amend the parent LLCs charter to add a new series.
- Tax filing requirements for these entities? It seems that given Cayman is a tax free jurisdiction, for non-US individuals, this should be a relatively simple process?
- What potential tax liabilities might these entities incur? (if any)


### Series LLC Call: Jonathan
1. They have segregation from liability perspective
2. each SPC are not separate companies but they are cells
3. Cells can be created by board resolution
	1. Can work for different kind of assets 
	2. old days you could do A or B class share
	3. A and B class could get dipped into
	4. Audit: In that case A, B can get screwed for fund C
4.
