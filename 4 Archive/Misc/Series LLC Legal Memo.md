Trying to solve the following problem:
1. Person A is a resident of a foreign country C and runs a business
2. They earn money in USD; however, they cannot hold USD in their name directly due to capital control laws in the country

The current proposed solution is to:
1. Have person A open a series LLC, L in Wyoming
2. L will get an EIN number from the IRS
3. We help L do business globally and allow them to open a bank account using the EIN
4. L can get into contract and receive and spend money using the said bank account

Reporting Requirements:
1. Given L only does banking in the US and does not operate from the US, this could be considered a disregarded entity owned by A
2. Hence they will only file a WBEN-8 to the bank
3. At the end of the year they will file an information 1120 and 5472 to IRS
4. Person A will file regular income tax in their country C as this structure is a passthrough


Advise:

	1. ask your legal for referral
2. Mid tier firms
3. small business tax partners
4. ask around a few folks

MEMORANDUM

To: Alpine Empower LLC
From: [Your Name]
Re: Series LLC Legal Analysis

I. Introduction

This memorandum provides a legal analysis of the proposed solution for Person A, a resident of foreign country C, to open a series limited liability company (LLC) in Wyoming through Alpine Empower LLC ("Alpine Empower"). The solution aims to address the issue of capital control laws in country C that prohibit Person A from holding United States dollars (USD) directly. This memorandum evaluates the legal implications and reporting requirements associated with the proposed solution.

II. Proposed Solution

Under the proposed solution, Person A would open a series LLC, L, in Wyoming through Alpine Empower. L would obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), enabling it to conduct business globally and open a bank account using the EIN. L would enter into contracts, receive income, and make expenditures through this bank account.

III. Legal Implications

A. Disregarded Entity Status

Given that L only conducts banking activities in the United States and does not operate from within the country, L could be considered a disregarded entity owned by Person A for tax purposes. This means that L's income and expenses would flow directly to Person A for tax reporting purposes.

B. Reporting Requirements

1. WBEN-8 Form: As a disregarded entity owned by Person A, L will need to file Form WBEN-8 with the bank where it intends to open its bank account. This form certifies that L is exempt from certain U.S. information reporting and backup withholding requirements due to its status as a disregarded entity.

2. Information Return Forms 1120 and 5472: At the end of each fiscal year, L will be required to file an information return with the IRS using Forms 1120 and 5472. Form 1120 reports L's income, deductions, and tax liability, while Form 5472 discloses certain transactions between L and its foreign owners. It is essential to accurately complete these forms to comply with U.S. tax laws.

IV. Person A's Tax Obligations

Person A, as the owner of L, would be responsible for filing regular income tax returns in country C. As L is structured as a pass-through entity, any income generated by L would flow through to Person A for taxation purposes in country C.

V. Conclusion

The proposed solution of opening a series LLC in Wyoming through Alpine Empower appears legally feasible given the constraints outlined above. However, it is crucial to comply with the reporting requirements discussed in Section III to avoid potential penalties or legal complications.
