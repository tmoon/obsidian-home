### Email Sent to CEO
Dear Mr. Moynihan:

  

My name is Tarik Moon, and I am the CEO of a successful technology company. I am writing to you today as both a longtime customer and an ardent supporter of Bank of America since 2011.   

First of all, **I understand you are busy--however, I was not able to reach out to appropriate teams at BoA for a goodwill adjustment. So, if you could forward my following request to the appropriate team, I would greatly appreciate it.**

Over the years, I have worked diligently to maintain a high standard of financial responsibility. This dedication has resulted in a high credit score, reflecting my commitment to handling my financial obligations appropriately.  
  
However, I recently came across a one time late payment report on my Bank of America account (account no: 004637490241, credit ending in: 4931) that was reported as one time late payment of 30 days and it is having a significant impact on my credit score.  
  
I am fully aware of the importance of timely payments and the negative implications that such incidents can have on one's credit history. I would like to emphasize that this was an isolated incident, completely uncharacteristic of my usual financial habits--I was moving during that time and had to deal with a family emergency.

As a significant income earner and loyal customer, I am hopeful that Bank of America can show some leniency in this unique situation. Thus, I am respectfully requesting a goodwill adjustment to remove this incident from my record. 

I understand that the bank has policies to follow and it may not be a common practice to make such adjustments. However, I firmly believe that this single incident does not accurately reflect my usual financial behavior or my dedication as a Bank of America customer. I am hopeful that you can view my request favorably.  

I have greatly valued my relationship with Bank of America over the past decade and hope to continue banking with you for many more years to come. I believe this goodwill adjustment would maintain the strength and integrity of this relationship.  

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support. Please feel free to reach out to me over email or my phone at 617-359-2770.
