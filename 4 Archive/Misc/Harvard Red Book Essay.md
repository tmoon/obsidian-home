[Home has always been a fluid concept for me. Over the past ten years since leaving Harvard Yard, I've come to realize that home isn't just a place—it's something we build through experiences, relationships, and the futures we create together.

In 2015, I embarked on a journey to San Francisco, being an early part of starting EDO, a venture in entertainment analytics and AI. The city, vibrant with innovation, became my new home, not because of its location, but because of the sense of purpose and community I found there. Building something from the ground up was both challenging and exhilarating, and it reinforced my belief that we can craft the future and shape it.

In 2018, however, I faced an unexpected obstacle when my U.S. visa expired. Leaving the country I had grown to love was difficult, but it also underscored that home is not tied to geography alone. My path led me to Shanghai, where I launched a data security blockchain project. Immersing myself in a different culture taught me invaluable lessons about adaptability and broadened my understanding of what home could be.

After a year abroad, I returned to the United States in 2019 with a green card and a renewed vision. In 2021, I co-founded Affine, focusing on blockchain financial products. This venture felt like the culmination of years of global experiences, each contributing to a more expansive definition of home and community.

Amidst these professional endeavors, I met my wife, an Uyghur-Turkish entrepreneur whose spirit and drive mirror my own. Together, we've explored the peaks of the Yosemite to the Alps, finding joy and connection in climbing mountains and skiing slopes across the U.S. and Europe. Our adventures have taught me that home is also found in shared passions and the person beside you. We married in Istanbul in 2023, in Hagia Sophia, a holy shrine that was both a Church and a mosque, a place that perfectly symbolizes the bridging of cultures and continents—much like our own relationship.

The world has undoubtedly changed since our time at Harvard, especially with the challenges brought on by the 2020 pandemic, the recent wars. Missing our reunion was a stark reminder of life's unpredictability. Yet, these times have only strengthened my optimism. As a tech CEO, I am inspired by the endless possibilities that innovation brings. I firmly believe that we have the power to build the future we envision, crafting not just technology, but communities and connections that transcend borders.

Moving between countries and cultures has taught me that home is not a static place but a dynamic construct—one that we actively build through our actions, relationships, and dreams. It's about creating spaces where we and others can thrive, no matter where we are in the world.

To my classmates, those with whom I shared late-night problem sessions and early-morning meals at Annenberg, I hope your journeys have also led you to build homes and futures that inspire you. Here's to the next decade of creating, connecting, and constructing the world we wish to see.]()
