    The LRT Episode
    
    The interview is about Amit Gilla, the founder of Kelp, a liquid staking platform. He discusses his background, the lessons he learned from his previous experience at Sta and how he is applying them to Kelp. The focus of Kelp is on creating access for reaking and defi integrations to create real utility for users. Kelp is also launching native reaking and working on L2 expansion, LP pools, and partnerships with Ledger and other wallet partners to provide reaking where users are using their platforms.

    Ethereum 'Restaking' Takes Shape as Next Big Trend in Blockchain Security
    
    "Ethereum 'Restaking' Takes Shape as Next Big Trend in Blockchain Security" introduces the concept of restaking in the crypto landscape, where staked Ethereum tokens are repurposed for smaller networks and applications to reduce the costs of setting up new projects. EigenLayer is a pioneering protocol in restaking, aiming to extend decentralized trust from Ethereum to other systems, offering additional income opportunities for stakers. Despite potential risks like slashing penalties and conflicts of interest, restaking could lead to new cryptoeconomic protocols and collaborations within the crypto ecosystem, aligning with Ethereum's long-term interests.

bankless Nation welcome to the LRT episode today we have a different kind of podcast than what you would normally expect out of the bankless podcast feed today we are talking with six different teams at different times not all at once all in the LRT space five different LRT teams and then chuna McCain from ion protocol who can give us a little bit more of a meta perspective as to how to view the entire LRT landscape I'm making this episode because there are so many questions that we have about the reaking

and LRT ecosystem it is developing at a mile a minute and the number of questions that we have are growing faster than the answers that I think we have for them and so I'm hoping to help answer some of those questions that we have in the LRT space what are the risks of lrts what are the different strategies of lrts what are the different directions that different lrts are going in I've always thought that the LRT game is one by maximizing exposure and minimizing risk and each one of the LRT teams that you're going to hear from in the episode has

different strategies of getting that done and different priorities different orders of operations in this episode you're going to hear from ethery puffer kelp swell and Renzo in that order all about their different LRT strategies what they are doing and what their road map is some of them have explicitly teased their token generation event but all of them will have a token I bet I'm guessing there a prediction in the year 2024 and probably in the first half but diving head first into the lrts might be kind of a lot so first we're to talk to

chunda from ion protocol and ion protocol is an aggregator of lrts kind of like it's kind of like a compound so LRT and lsts go in one side and then vanilla ether goes out on the other side where all of the different lrts are producing different flavors of e ion uses a compound style Market maker application to reaggregate and re homogenize all of the E that comes out of igen lay so we can more efficiently use capital in Defi and because of this

position that ion protocol has in the space they have to be extra cautious and extra informed about all the different choices that lrts are making so that is why chunda comes first in this interview he is going to provide a framework for understanding how to evaluate lrts at a meta level and then we will go into the individual LRT projects every single interview is 15 minutes or less I think the tuna interview is maybe 18 minutes but this is meant to really give you broad exposure to the entire LRT

landscape and kind of download you very quickly about all the different players here so that we can all be informed about what's coming inside of the igen layer ecosystem so let's start with our interview with chunda from ion protocol first and then we will get into the lrts after that we got chunda McCain of ion protocol chunda welcome to the show thank you for having me David it's a pleasure to be here I want to PE peek into your brain about how you think about the LRT ecosystem before we do that I think think we need to explain to

listeners what ion protocol is and what vantage point it provides for viewing all of the different lrts uh cuz you're kind of at The Meta level you're at the bird's eye view satellite uh level view of the whole LRT landscape maybe could explain a little bit about ion protocol and what it does and how it informs your thinking about the LRT space yeah 100% so uh I guess I'm going give a little bit of context about myself and kind of how the idea of ion kind of came about because I think it'll provide a good kind of foundational starting point to

kind of understand a little bit more on how we're approaching the the problems of addressing LRT risk and and specifically how do we want to approach Financial underwriting of LRT risks so a little bit about myself been in the crypto space I'd say I first learned about it back in 2015 but really got into in the birth of defi 1718 era and just started writing white papers on like peer-to-peer lending Market design um and then starting doing research on AI based credit risk analysis Frameworks not for defi but actually for in the

more traffi context uh thinking about how we can actually build systems for people who don't have access to like FICO scores or extensive credit history and trying to get build an approach um from more like turistic um uh data to say like okay uh how can we assure that these un un and underbanked people in America gain access to the traditional Financial RS other people have and so you know thinking about those types of things in crypto uh kind of emerging like defi merging onto the scene at around the same time at least set the stage for me to like it it just

immediately clicked and so for me um I spent you know kind of the next I guess until now seven years um kind of getting engaged in the space working from you know being a software engineer like a smart contract engineer like a Neo Bank building out crypto infrastructure there uh to working at defi startups to even spending a little bit of time in Venture um and it was actually my time in Venture I was working on the blockchain capital team back when we were looking at the Igan layer deal I think this was late 2022 um that I first I got my first

glance into what igen was as a concept um and it just I mean it was one of those like I'd say it's probably like the second most important lifeold moment of my time in crypto because the idea of extending uh the core concept of cryp cryptoeconomic security of ether as an asset and which is basically the whole value proposition why we all use eth as kind of the current status quo settlement layer um in the crypto ecosystem extending that kind of power that ethereum had to other networks and

other services just immediately made sense and I realized there there was kind of a big problem that existed uh within this context in in in defi in particular which is that we don't really have Primitives that internalize um all this infrastructure risk that exists in um reaking platforms this idea that instead of underwriting like traditional financial leverage or or these terms that were're more familiar with in def5 I think you guys kind of mentioned this recently there is no inherent leverage in uh reaking the

risk that you're taking on effectively is like uh there's a bit of game theoretical risk about like dode operator activity um there's a bit of infrastructure based risk about um like ABS setups and consensus Network setups um and then you also have um a bit of risk around like the the balancing the principal agent problem and like the centralization from node operator to network perspective right and so for us we were like all right in order to

tackle this problem we need to first ask the questions of like what is needed um in the the reaking space and then like all right how do we build this infrastructure so in terms of what was needed we're ion effectively uh is a lending platform meant to underwrite all of these different types of risks to allow people to financialized their reaking positions as well as staking positions um without having to uh kind of depend on the traditional means of financial underwriting that exists with like you know counter party amm

liquidity and and really deep like Dex liquidity and and also all these like price oracles and and kind of taking a step away from that infrastructure and thinking about all right what are the specific things about this Market that are important for us to address that was a super useful explanation I think one of the very interesting things about um igen layer and liquid reaking tokens is that at first glance everyone sees igen layer and they see the concept of you you take your eth you st and then you stake it

again and then again and then again and then everyone is like oh but that's like we're like stacking risk on risk on risk which is true uh and so like then people's like heckles start to like rise up a little bit about just like okay what are the risks of Ian lay it's a very natural response and then like you layer on lrts on top of that and lrts are all playing the same game of like managing that risk uh and then there's your game which is managing the net aggregate of all the LRT risks and so it's this simultane anous like yield

seeking risk seeking um inherent nature about I igen layer matched with like okay but like let's contain all of the risks too because ultimately at the end of the day igen layer like you said is going to reach out to far beyond the horizons of of crypto leveraging cryptoeconomic security providing new products to like trafi to the SAS model to like San Francisco Silicon Valley and so it actually measuring and containing risk is really really important so like it's this kind of like Two-Face nature

of like reaking which is like more risk more yield more upside but we're going to manage it all and that's kind of how like that's why I think this space is so interesting and your perspective is not just like a user we have a lot of users listening to this episode who are trying to get their um just get educated about the risks of lrts you are coming from a a protocol perspective because you are building a protocol and so you have to think about it a little bit differently can you illustrate some of the inputs that go into the risk assessment like

what what are the different things that ion protocol assesses when it does its underwriting of the LRT is like what are the inputs that are actually being evaluated yeah that's a really good question um I think a a good thing to to remind everyone as well is uh this concept that lrts at first before they're ever lrts they're lsts a lot of them anyone that supports native staking you're building an LST protocol first and then you're building an on top of that right so our first approach is to

actually um tackle that um and say like all right we need to evaluate all of these different providers um I call them providers because effectively that they they act in a very similar kind of function um and we need to assess all right specifically how do you look as a provider first because that's your core that's the core dependency that exists right now especially without ion lay being live we need to answer a question and make sure that everyone uh in from a provider

infrastructure standpoint is being safe so for for those things we we look at we take into account uh node operator setups the idea of kind two things one it's like a technical implementation standpoint um are you requiring bonds who has access to the node operator Keys uh is it the user is it um the underlying node operator has all the control who decides what node operators get included is it permissioned permissionless how exactly are you choosing these node operators who are

these node operators are they docs are they undocks all these questions that you would traditionally ask in liquid staking provider context um we're also asking for these lrts so that's the systemwide kind of perspective you also have technical implementation details are important as well how much are you using uh DVT are you using DVT at all do you plan on integrating tees to abstract away uh key ownership um how what's your client diversity looking like right all of these uh kind of more infrastructure

based questions or are also things that we're looking at internally when it comes to assessing these various different providers on the staking level now after the staking level then the approach is okay uh you kind of have to balance two things when it comes to um uh AVS delegation which which creates this this actually interesting thing which I think we you know we we wrote a bit of a paper on it um with with some uh a folks uh I'm sure we can link that later but um what we call it is a the efficient Frontier of uh reaking risk

where you know even if you're delegating Capital to what we seem as like the most safe avss you still end up centralizing your risk vectors and so there's actually this interesting balance that you have to take where you want to decentralize your delegation your internal delegation to multiple avss thereby technically earning more yield but uh also finding that balance where you don't over allocate to abss that

take on additional risk um and so this idea of like creating silos of where your uh allocating and delegating your risk and diversifying that risk across multiple different ABS delegations um is something that we're considering a lot and and the one big thing right now and and this goes a little bit more on kind of like infrastructure based underwriting um is this idea of like how common is this type of consensus model proof of stake and bft based consensus

protocols have existed for a long time we understand their risks really well um and you know as we've seen in throughout the history of ethereum we can mitigate those risks pretty decently well so far um but one of the big concerns is when we start innovating on novel consensus models even da based consensus models have some interesting things that make things like anti- slashers unviable for da um which is an interesting kind of constraint there you then we kind of start ending up walking into Uncharted

Territory where we're not exactly sure what Black Swan events look like in these situations what can cause them and even what does the status quo of that Network look like and so for us I think we're going to be heavily indexing and I think users should also think about heavily indexing on what kind of consensus models and what kind of underlying infrastructure are people building that we're already used to underwriting and we're already used to kind of assessing within the context of ethereum and the consensus protocols exist

today one of the roles that ion protocol will will do is it'll have a algorithm I'm assuming uh to actually like judge parameters just to make it super clear ion protocol like compound but lrts go in one side and just normal e goes out the other or L yeah or or LS LS lsts on yes right yeah any sort of e derivative on one side uh and that's bit with a protocol underneath uh and then um

vanilla eth on the on the outside U which means that you need to have an algorithm to like produce parameters risk parameters about the clal assets this will of course ingest some of the inputs that I asked you about earlier but like also how do you even design the algorithm because where do you get the data to even make waiting decisions right like this is we've never done this before you're doing it first how the hell are you doing it what do you know like how how do you actually like build this thing yeah that's a very good question and it actually goes to the like the two things that concern me the

most with igen layer like holistically right the two things that concern me the most about igay has nothing to has nothing actually to do with IG lay the product but instead on how we are able to observe the product those two things are opacity on data basically the limitations on being able to see access in in view data uh in real time when it comes to all of these networks and then two is like the ability to then ingest and analyze that data I feel like there

that is kind of a a sector of reaking where we haven't really seen too many announcements of people building infrastructure like scalable infrastructure around that and that infrastructure is going to be crucial to informing users on how to actually participate in this ecosystem and that's hopefully you know some one of the things that we want to be one of the Pioneers in is we we built out right now we built the zkl based framework that

ingests ethereum consensus data we use a variety of different data sources uh some kind of centralized data provider apis some utilizing you know building our in-house solution that uh draws like we can chain data directly eventually we're going to be incorporating inputs via uh ZK State proofs uh to further decentralize um and make our inputs more trustless and we built this uh zkl framework or xeric machine learning framework that allows us to um analyze what we see as like common potential

risk factors in ethereum uh ethereum's like uh Network in order to be able to kind of not necessarily mitigate but uh have a better understanding of what kind of volatility could exist um on a you know fixed time basis uh for slashing on ethereum the extension of that is now now that we've built out the system for ethereum and like I mentioned before most consensus Protocols are going to fit within this like kind of like BF based um consensus model um we plan on

extending uh this kind of framework and of course testing it uh before we really allow uh robust Capital efficiency if for allow these abss uh but testing this uh framework with other networks as well to and benchmarking it based off the initial results we get from ethereum to be able to see whether or not uh we can actually kind of scale uh these like robust data Frameworks across abss and ideally hopefully we can um uh eventually open source these Frameworks and allow other people to build their

own uh kind of unique Frameworks to assess uh these different networks as well so Chun to during the middle of this interview that we're doing right now I have decided to instead of having this interview be at the very end I'm going to put at the very beginning because I think it provides a framework for listeners to have as they enter these five different LRT projects uh you've actually listened to every single one of these um we we gave you the the material ahead of time just so you could review what do you think listeners should know or what framework should

they understand what do they need to think about as they are listening to these different LRT projects talk about their own strategy uh what would you want to have known going into this uh the first time around yeah so there there's a couple things um that I think is really important for every user to kind of ask themselves these are the few questions that we always want people to ask themselves um and actually split them up into to Vertical that's really easy um for for you to create this kind of like internal checklist to go and say like okay I'm going I'm going to check

off you know each one of these boxes and see which LRT or you know reaking solution or what have you um has each one of these things so uh the first one like you know we we've been chatting a little bit before about is um operators and specifically operator setups and operator risk um The Operators are the lifeblood of Igan they're the lifeblood of staking they're the ones who are running the hardware instances or AWS instances depending on a person um that

that make all of uh these networks run right and so within uh the operator framework you should be asking yourself who are these operators um how are they selected um how much control do they have over the capital do you as the user who holds the asset or are you permissionless able to kind of retrieve your capital from these operators or do the operators control those keys well which is it right um uh asking about operator decentralization how many operators exist um or is there a network

of them right um and then finally uh asking yourself um event like is there a road map to permissionless with operator inclusion is is that on the road map is that something that's going to be app plan for the long run so that that's kind of uh the operator framework uh the the other framework um I I like to ask is just about kind of access control for you as a user do you have access to withdrawals right do you have access uh to your underlying Capital at at any

time right or is it the node oper that has access to that um how are you um actually able to retrieve the underlying rewards here um is that something that um you're always able to retrieve when you withdraw things like this so you should always be asking yourself uh when you're kind of depositing to these Frameworks and also what is actually happening underneath the hood when I deposit understanding is it actually getting stake into an LST is itting getting staked um into their own

validators where is that Capital actually going questions you should be asking yourself um and then finally uh I'll actually I have four of these um but finally the last one for the lrts which I think is um uh the I call this like the the future the future proofing vertical is the questions of like okay what are they looking towards in the future of like future proofing the system uh DVT usage is DVT a large priority for them I think DT and the idea of even taking a single node

operator and then splitting up the access control between multiple entities and a single node operator makes the difficulty of slashing that much higher right the same thing with te usage humans and human input is for ethereum at least is most of the reason why slashing events ever happen if you remove humans from the equation your risk of slashing goes immensely down right so by removing human Val equation by using things like tees you're able to kind of mitigate slashing RIS as well um

those are kind of the two main things but I'm sure other people will be building uh really interesting and innovative ways to kind of future proof uh staking and reaking in the long the final thing I would ask is also you know the the more practical thing what can you do with this asset right is it just going to be restak um can you use Indi are they prioritizing implementations in l2's bridges can you reduce your cost things like that those are also things that are important just from a user experience standpoint and although in in crypto we tend to have a you know bad R

for good ux uh I think you know is something we we should be asking ourselves and prioritizing as well although of course you know I put this as one vertical I think we should also wait this idea of like Safety and Security a lot more than just kind of these ux Improvement tra I'm so glad that I brought you into this uh this conversation I think that that was immensely helpful for the listeners as they are about to uh hear all five of these interviews um just one maybe one last message for the listeners is like we're starting to color in a picture here um the interviews that you are

about to hear are going to help you further color in that picture but there's just so much more research to be done I only really was able to um you know touch on the surface level of each one of these uh each one of these LRT projects so like each one kind of represents some homework to be done chunda here just gave you the Frameworks to do your homework with and by so thank you chunda for that uh chunda you talked about some resources we will put those links in the show notes but overall if people just want to learn more about ion

protocol and learn more about the way that you think about risks in lrts where should they go yeah 100% um if you want to check us out at ion protocol we post a lot of content about this kind of stuff as well as the things we're thinking about internally when it comes to building out the protocol um so just check us out um on Twitter ion protocol one word um you can uh take a look at our our recent uh work with uh SCH research and the guys at Abu Finance we

this framework that I've been talking about we put that on and added even more uh kind of a larger checklist that you can kind of run through and ask yourself uh questions of okay what is important uh about you know me using all these different LRT Solutions and then also we had a little bit of a Sprinkle in there about what is important about defy solutions that actually claim to underwrite these lrts um we put a couple uh a couple different examples in there for you guys to to interact with and learn a little bit more about um and then if you're interested in kind of hearing my thoughts about you i' like to

post a little random things about ethereum or uh infra stuff and you know how they may have implications on staking and reaking uh feel free to follow me just @ chunan on on Twitter uh you can check everything out there beautiful cha we will get all those links and your Twitter into the show notes thank you so much for for all this knowledge yeah appreciate the invite man got you all right thanks so much chunda now let's go ahead and get into all of the different lrts but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially Kraken our preferred crypto

help revolutionize the reaking universe okay so Mike uh talk to us about how you came to the conclusion to work in the LRT space to build ethery what was the inspiration where did it come from and how did you end up uh building ethery ethery actually started as a fund an eth staking fund and we realized that there actually wasn't a product on the market that we were comfortable using ourselves and so we really built ether to solve our own problem to solve the issue of e custody and risk management and to build something that was natively

integrated with reaking from the ground up how did the team come together who are your co-founders what does the company look like the court team consists of myself Rock Joseph and rert I founded the team and the CEO rert is our head of engineering Joseph is our coo and rock is our head of Revenue okay uh and then eventually ether F went from fund to LRT can you talk about that like AA moment or Eureka moment moment just talk to us about that decision yeah so believe it or not we

plan to build ethery as an LRT from day one when we were raising our seed round we were talking about reaking at the core of the protocol because we saw that as a natural extension of proof of stake on ethereum was always meant to be a LRT that would also allow users to deposit or is an LRT for like just increasing the yields of the funds ether like or has the like Northstar always been the same that's a great question so no initially we started as a fund and within a few months we pivoted to

building a product because my previous life I built a product company and I want to do that again in in ethereum rather than running a fund okay uh let's talk about ethery as a product there are so many LRT teams out there that's why we're doing this episode uh what about ethery is unique what makes it stand out so there's two things that make ethery interesting the first is that it's the only staking protocol that allows stakers to hold hold on to their keys with every other liquid staking protocol

the node operator controls your keys and effectively has sort of a strangle hold on your custody of your e the second thing is we were the very first protocol that was natively restak from the ground up uh and so that's why we were able to get to Market first and become the largest liquid staking protocol and the the other thing I'll say is believe it or not it actually is not that crowded of space because although there are probably 50 different lrts right now uh nearly all of them are just wrappers of some LST or another uh and there's only a handful of actual natively restak

liquid tokens and that includes us it includes swell includes Renzo which are really awesome teams that uh uh we think are building cool things in the space let's unpack those one by one uh let's start with that first one the one that uh where node operators retain their own keys can you just unpack that a little bit kind of kind of explain like I'm five what that means yeah so there's a a big challenge with most most liquid sticking uh protocols in that when you deposit your eth into really any liquid staking protocol a node operator

generates the keys and Spins up a validator you need that validator key that the notor operator generates in order to be able to get your eth back so when you go to Lio or or any other protocol that has withdrawals which is actually not that many uh and try to get your eth back you submit a withdrawal request what it does in the background is it effectively just voluntarily requests that a node operator return the eth by exiting a validator and now that introduces a lot of counterparty risk in

particular with protocols that have centralized node operators it it basically makes them a Target uh it makes it very easy to have a situation where you are not able to get your eth back with ethery stakers act as Bond holders and generate the keys and there's an economic incentive mechanism to make sure you get your eth back so when you go to ethery and request the withdrawal if your withdrawal is not honored somebody's eth gets slashed and so that basically mean it makes it very likely that you're going to get your your e back this sounds like an

innovation on the LST layer which the LRT layer is built on top of but first it sounds like a little bit like this is improving even just the raw normal ethereum staking stack for um uh delegated staking yeah uh so I don't think that there should be two categories I think it's a dumb idea to have lrts and lsts all liquid staking Protocols are going to be lrts within a year it's be something that's foundational to staking on ethereum so

yes we call ourselves an LST because we think all lsts eventually are going to have reaking baked in beautiful okay uh so this I'm guessing this implies that individuals can become node operators with uh ether fire corre yeah that's exactly right so currently it is not a fully permissionless system we've got about a 100 solo stakers who are operating nodes for ethery uh within about two months it's going to be a fully permission system so anybody will be able to show up with a two eth Bond

uh and DVT managed Keys uh be able to spin up a validator run it and generate an income beautiful okay leveraging DVT uh what are the the collateral requirements is there a collateral in the system yeah so there's two a two e Bond requirement for anybody that runs a validator in order to have one Shard of the the validator cluster one unique thing about ether 5 is you guys are incubating an AVS is that correct and can you tell me more we are yeah we're really excited about this uh so we are uh the plan is to

build on top of our liquid staking uh protocol and add components to it that make it differentiated that hopefully generate higher returns for users one of the ways that we're doing that is by actually building an in-house uh AVS specifically and I have this is some Alpha right here um it's called dbridge and it is a decentralized RPC service similar to like a pocket network but built on uh reaking on I there we're super excited about that uh we're actually going to be publicly talking

about it aside from here I guess for the first time uh in the next probably two or three weeks uh and then we'll be launching a beta a couple months after that okay so how does a decentralized RPC leverage ethereum security to improve its product so uh every ethereum node in the world uh has an RPC endpoint that's just how the the protocol Works an RPC endpoint it's basically just a way to talk to the ethereum node and get you know data out of it or submit transactions to the blockchain so this is something that's already part of the

network ethery has now thousands and thousands probably 10,000 different uh nodes that run on ethery and each one of those has an RPC endpoint and so the decentralized RPC uh service just leverages these existing RPC endpoints puts a bunch of load balancers in front of them and allows users to make use of this mostly idle infrastructure that's kind of sitting there uh you know valid validating blocks periodically okay so ether fi was built

to be an LRT from the ground up from day one uh you guys had your own own Capital that I think you guys have put into the ethery system because you guys were a fund prior to that uh you have this unique uh uh node operators retain their own Keys setup which uh allows for more stakers their keys stakers have their own Keys which allows for just more permissionless and uh stake or sovereignty in the system um and you guys have your own AVS that you guys are incubating internally uh what else would

you add to this like report card so I would say you know it's always uh hard to make a a subjective claim but I would say we're super ethereum aligned I mean the reason that uh we're doing this is because we're really we really are passionate about ethereum and crypto and what it stands for you know the founding team myself certainly we we've made enough money that we don't need to be you know working for a living day-to-day uh we're doing this because we actually believe that it's going to help the network and because we believe in the mission of crypto of self- sovereignty

and giving people more control over their uh uh their wealth so they can't be taken away from them um and so we're super ethereum aligned you know we we're giving 1% to the protocol Guild which is the the team that builds the ethereum uh protocol 1% of our token uh Supply uh we've got the you know Sasso on our uh Advisory Board we've got a member of the James Smith member of the ethereum foundation of a on our Advisory Board um you know we're we treat this stuff seriously at the start of our white paper it you know outlines our

principles and what we believe in and at the core of it is that we'll do the right thing for the network um I think that matters I think you know it's easy to think about short terms and token pumps and all that nonsense but I genuinely we we plan to be doing this for another 10 20 years um and so we're we're trying to make the right decisions for the long term so ethery is coming in at approaching $700 million ether deposited into your guys' um contracts uh that placing it as number one in the

LRT race to what to what do you credit the reason why ether fi is currently the number one in attracted Capital well I think some of the things that we talked about so one we were the first that naturally you know sort of confers an advantage uh uh you know aside from building a good product that was just good uh good timing um uh I think I like to believe that our ethereum alignment and messaging and the brand that we've put out there has made a difference that people you know

believe that they can trust us uh and we hope to live up to that uh you know expectation um so yeah all those things we've also done a really good job of Integrations so we're plugged into I think more dii protocols than anybody else we're starting to uh Deploy on layer twos um and you know a bunch of other areas that make the token ultimately more useful for for users is there something in ether future a road map item that is is exciting that you users might be interested in so the the

thing that I'm most excited about in the in the coming months of ethery uh the first is that we are going to be announcing our series a fundraising maybe by the time this uh episode airs we have already announced it so we're working with some pretty awesome investors that we're really excited about uh and then the uh the second thing is that we are in fact going to be doing our token launch uh we think our users are going to be super happy with that uh uh we're doing some pretty interesting and unique uh things with the with the and uh you know we hope that It ultimately ends up helping the

ecosystem Mike if you have pequ the Curiosity of any listeners of this episode and they want to learn more about ether F where should they go just go to Ether DOI ether DOI and then you could you know hang out you can stake your eth you can check out our Discord whatever uh whatever you want awesome thanks Mike B the station I'm super excited to introduce you to Amir from puffer Amir welcome to the show thank you David thank you so much for having me Amir tell us a little bit about yourself and how you came to be at puffer and then we'll get into how puffer came to be an LRT but first the

first two questions absolutely well I'm uh the CEO at puffer Labs where we're building the entire puffer ecosystem and how did puffer come to be where did puffer come from well that's a very great question we actually started um to think about puffer um way like before on a foundational level we started to look into bringing scalable compute to ethereum through the use of tees of course we met Justin Drake uh in our journey and we realized that the blockchain is not decentralized enough

and it's not ready for the confidential compute and AI that we're uh focusing to bring on chain there he proposed to use the same technologies that we were familiar with trusted execution environments to actually build anti-s slashers this was back in the day where actually all the talks were about Lio and Rocket pool uh and we started to focus on building the most scalable and decentralized LSD and from this idea we came to an important conclusion that

building anti-s slashers reducing risks is not going to be enough reducing the bond is not going to be enough and we need to actually grow the rewards P for the validators to be able to make it more viable to host your own node or even maybe run your node at home that's where we were introduced to shiram to enable reaking so both validators and stakers can now generate more rewards this opened the window for us to actually do specialized avss through the use of only uh tees enabled to our

validators as well that's where puffer came from it's basically on its base layer it's an evolution to liquid staking on ethereum and the upgrades that we made to it actually enables many interesting features enabled on liquid reaking as well okay cool te trusted execution environment uh sadly every single time we talk air we're going to have to Define what that is because because most people don't know what that is what is a te and then what does it do for a puffer basically you can think of

a te a secure portion of the hardware that runs computation in it it's encrypted through cryptography what does it do it in puffer the easiest way to explain this with Justin Drake is very good at explaining this is you can think of it as a hardware validator uh Hardware wallet for your validator where your keys are generated in there they're protected in there and in puffer we not only protect the validator keys inside

of a te but also we protect the database of previously signed material so it's a separate stack running aside with a consensus client and an execution client that checks every signature that the validator operator is going to produce if that signature is going to produce a stashable uh message basically this um anti- slasher says uh rejects it mhm that's where it becomes an anti slasher and that's how te is working puffer okay so I I've defined um the LRT game as a

competition to maximize exposure to avss and therefore yield while also minimizing risks there are a variety of different reasons uh categories of slashing events that could happen to an LRT to a to um an operator uh and then what you're saying is that there is this um trick this Hardware trick with using tees Intel sgx people might be more familiar with that actually protects against a certain class of slashing events can you kind of like delineate

between the types of slashing events that te leveraging te protects against and what class of slashing events it does not well we are actually um releasing articles like one at a time we're actually our docs is very up to date we recently uploaded the docs we a deep dive of how reaking and staking works on puffer just please go to docs. puffer um our the Twitter is a good source our mediums are a good source as

well with our latest views but we are going to release more on this like more future road map and future steps if an operator would like to break the trust boundaries of this te basically break into it grab their key out which we will be back to the status quo of running an ethereum node they can cause like his self slashing event which is of course malicious but really this anti- Slasher prevents all slashing on ethereum L1

preventing all slashing is like that's a really big statement is it is it really that big is it really that like Rock Solid it is because really it is so hard the the concept of slashing is so easy defined on ethereum proof of stake it is so hard to produce a slashing event and therefore like preventing it from the hardware side is also not that hard but it's been mostly if you've seen the past slashing events either it was from a malicious actor who wanted to extract

more Me by causing a reorg or it's been just a mistake by big node operators where what they usually do is they do this thing called load balancing they spin up nodes spontaneously at the same time and they do a double signing on a block and therefore it causes slashing for them this really mitigates this all existing risks from mistakes really it's something to protect against all the mistakes AK there is a like a mystery and demystification here if someone

turns off their hardware and don't commit to arrestation or proposing blocks they do not get slashed they're just going to miss rewards and have a very small penalty and I think this is very important okay so we talked about te as like a the competitive Advantage with the fundamentals of puffer if you will like what sets it apart from others um but what about the actual like strategy of puffer what is like the the near-term road map the the plan for action like what what does the the near-term look

like for puffer what's the plan here absolutely I think we have Beyond just anti- slashers our strategy is focus on Research focus on Native reaking and focus on ethos alignment I can now unwrap each of these focusing on Research puffer has been the decentralizing runway for ethereum why do we say this a lot of the research and products that we introduced to puffer actually come from the wish list of all the eips that are yet to be passed but out of protocol for example there is EIP

7002 this is going to enforce a smart contract ejection of validators on ethereum from execution layer this is good because especially in liquid staking platforms if a trust uh less basically untrusted node operator drops below a certain uh value we can just eject it from the uh execution layer this is not going to be implemented maybe in the next 2 years this is a key factor to have to creating a

permissionless decentralized protocol we got around that by introducing our Guardians so aside from anti-s slashers that makes it more secure to run a note we introduced Guardians so the stakers actually don't lose money if the validators just turn off their Hardwares and walk away and we find out that actually implementing these are translating really well to reaking if we have a more protected base layer of liquid staking through anti-s slashers

it means the E that is protecting these AVS is also is more protected if like the a big challenge in Native reaking today is If there is a AVS level slashing happens on a layer there is no slashing can happen unless we can eject the validator first their e goes to the withdrawal address and withdrawal address that points to the aen P get slashed without it we can't really have native staking live that's where puffer can enable native raking go live through

this implementation of the research that we did on the Bas layer we say we focus on Native reaking why do we say that because it has many advantages compared to just like LST reaking one of them being that the node operators also can take advantage of the rewards if any other protocol just turns on LSD reaking the base node operators on those platforms get nothing they don't get exposed to the rewards from the reate that's where we say it increase the rewards spy and users can make more

therefore it's easier for me to run a validator at home and U make more rewards imagine puffer is this platform you run an eth validator with one eth only and you also get reaking rewards which is not enabled on any other platform so that's on Native reaking also a quick Advantage is the advantages of reaking that can be brought to ethereum mainnet itself including meev Boost Plus including base rollups that I know Justin talked about in the previous

episode as well and many other features that are not enabled without RIS taking on the ethereum maget itself we sa your ethos aligned we need to actually keep ethereum decentralized as much as possible and that's has been our strategy that's why we're selfing our liquid steak into 22% total eat steak and also all these researches we're doing is aiming to keep the centralization runway to ethereum main I here you alluded to it a little bit but

I want to go into it a little bit more um again going back to like the whole idea lrts are trying to maximize exposure while minimize risks um one way you could another present that is um being sufficiently defensive as in making sure nothing gets slashed while also being sufficiently offensive which is making sure you go get yields you go get uh the the rewards being paid out by the ABS networks this is kind of why we're all doing this it's really what everyone's excited about um how does puffer and and leveraging te can te um

enable like relationships with avss that some sort of um LRT without te could not access like how can how can this become like a service for avss absolutely the first and the foremost easiest way that te enables is just the anti-slash key management is a very important concept and like we really like to see uh like a layer as transferring all the existing infrastructure on ethereum to restating

MH and it's very simple to use te on top of middle words like Bridges oracles and everything else to actually make sure that the activity that is supposed to be done is getting done in uh those Key Management scenarios for example even if you want to create an L2 based on uh basically an AVS te comes into play to play the similar role that it plays on the consensus layer just prevent slash offenses from being signed by the

sequencers so these are the very basically unique things that puffer can provide but also the kind of like the craziest thing is puffer nodes can become one ABS as an anti- slasher to all the other abss basically we can provide anti- slashing as a service as an ABS across the map and as you know there is a lot of research going around confidential compute and also verifiable

computation there is fhe there is NPC there is ZK one of the more practical for forms of confidential compute is tees if you want to bring AI confidential AI something that I think worldcoin like focused on a little bit this actually can be enabled with a big network of tees on puffer which sets it apart from all the others interesting okay so let's go in to the specific uh state of puffer the specific implementation yall have collected a

bunch of um Lio staked eth uh there's a plan to swap that into puff eth can you talk about and that's where we currently are in the puffer road map talk about that event uh what's the road map for that and then what's the following road map after that absolutely to actually help reduce the dominance of one uh LSD player if you actually Tred to just focus on SD at this part of this campaign mhm you users actually get puff it in return where they can use it on D5 platforms it's liquid um this campaign

showed even if a ler is on on Main net people are ready for reaking so yes once we are going on mainnet we're going to redeem all these SD from Lio this actually today translate to almost 3 and a half% of existing uh s which is going to significantly actually help for the decentralization of the protocol mhm um on top of that once we go on Main net to pu holders um there is no differences

they keep their puit only the uh the rewards that is generated for them is now from puffer permissionless decentralized validators we are aiming to go on Main it completely fully permissionless today we are on test net with our permissionless notes we're opening the test net to uh public very soon actually I think this is going to be another very big milestone where people can oh wow I can spin up a one E validator I think this is for the kind of like first time with no extra

overhead they just have the same stack that they have at home with just the addition of like the anti- slasher which runs separate from that part of Stack they can spin up one eth notes um moving forward we're sprinting to main net we're going to have main net on that layer also we're going to natively restate the eth on existing I layer pods in parallel we're going to work with uh existing abss and we're going to implement our own avss as well

another exciting part that I spoke about was this all existing infrastructure turning into a layer reaking and that's where puffer is capitalizing on it puffer is going to deploy its own L2 on its platform as an ABS now imagine this L2 is going to generate fees since the security provided to this L2 is from the puff e holders puff e holders are going to get a take advantage of the fees that L2 is

captured of course we implemented validator tickets that's a on hour conversation of what they are but uh they're essentially this L2 is going to be a market create this Marketplace for these validator tickets but nl2 cannot just be Standalone by itself nl2 needs an oracle nl2 needs a bridge all of these infrastructures today there are many companies that run these as abss they can be deployed on top of puffer and we can create this um infrastructure

super DB where they all feed back to the puff holder as extra revenue and also the node operators that's on our road map and it's like actually com in probably the second half of this year okay so a layer two from puffer leveraging te and uh being infrastructure for AV AVS is uh is a massive rabbit hole that sadly we don't have enough time to go into but if people want to learn more about that and just learn more about puffer where can they go well we are actually um

releasing articles like one at a time we're actually our docs is very up to date we recently uploaded the docs we did Deep dive of how reaking and staking works on puffer just please go to docs. puffer um our the Twitter is a good source our mediums are a good source as well with our latest views but we are going to release more on this like more future road map and future steps beautiful Amir thank you so much thank

you David Bank Nation I am here with Amit Gilla from kelp Amit welcome to the show thanks thanks David for having me here talk to us a little bit about your background where did you come from and how did you start kelow yeah I'm originally from Bangalore India uh I used to work at a Consulting strategy consulting firm here and then headed strategy and transformation at India's largest food Tech player been in crypto since 2020 uh started statea Labs one of the largest liquid

staking platform with 450 million in tvl and uh early 2023 we also started this new protocol called kelp do which is a liquid reaking platform beautiful uh okay so uh Stater into kelp Dow talk about just like the creation of Stater and like the lessons and experiences that you learned there and then we'll carry that into how you are applying those lessons at kelp a pretty amazing experience at sta uh so we were one of the early protocols on Terra 1.0 uh we had about a$ 1.5 billion

in tvl that completely had gone to zero right after the USD collapse multiple learnings first and foremost learning as a Founder is diversify uh Treasury and risks as much as possible which kind of led us to expand to multi- chains and today we are across present across six different chains with majority being on ethereum and polygon uh back then we already Diversified treasury but we learned the lessons of Treasury

Management in the hard way by losing some money in the USD collapse the third thing is team and uh uh people are the most important things uh people who believe in your vision as well as uh your leadership will stick so the most important lesson from the entire experience is higher people that are passionate as well as believe in the vision of the protocol okay so Stater uh and ethx is your staked eth token talk about just like the growth of Stater because

eventually this like I said will kind of like fold into into kpow talk about just like the experiences of growing Stater uh and and just like learning to build an LST numerous uh experiences there uh we have learned it the hard way and understood what are the major competitive modes for an LSD and obviously drawing those lessons to kelp da as well the biggest competitive mode for LST are creating these access or distribution points uh that is taking staking or taking lsts to places where

people are already using like for example some of the largest Hardware wallets like metamask largest Hardware wallets like Ledger wallets like metamask Etc where sta Solutions are already embedded natively that's where we see a majority of growth for our lsts the second and the most important things are creating real utility for these lsts like for example example we have deep Integrations with a compound and several other D5 Protocols of the world where

people find real use cases as opposed to Ponzi schemes where people go collateralize their lsts while earning those staking yields they can also borrow stable coins or they can borrow other assets that help them uh get to other uh yield opportunities so these two have been the most important and crucial uh learning aspects or competitive modes that we built with our listies on polygon now building those on ethereum and obviously carry those

forward to Kel as well right okay so there is a relationship between Stater and kelp and Stater the LST of course has ethx uh and the one of the big experiences that all LRT teams are going to have to fight against is like Integrations for their LRT tokens into defi uh and this is something that you've um sharpened your teeth with with ether with eth X and Stater just like getting ethx into like Ledger and metam mass so you can stake your eth with

State Earth via uh like Ledger live or metamask and then also like getting ethx into compound right just normal defi applications for LRT tokens uh eventually we will all need these things what you're saying stator's done this game before uh and so you're going to have to you're going to just take the same Playbook that you've developed at Stater you're going to apply it at kelp that's probably I'm assuming where this goes is that right that is one of the strengths that we borrow from our experience with ster but obviously lrts

given this uh given this is a new uh entire reaking and igen layer being new technology there are multiple risks associated with it obviously we can't apply the same Playbook Asis but the learnings are similar talk about the relationship between STA and kelow like how how did that whole thing work out how what what is the relationship there uh the relationship is very simple just the founders are common and Stater is one of the seed investors in kelp toow apart from that everything else is different

and uh one tactical relation is uh status eex is accepted as one of the deposit assets on kelta MH okay so Founders are common experiences are common is there like an ongoing relationship or are these two things going to like come together or diverge they they're going to be completely different kelp Dow uh as you probably know accepts uh three different lsts today lios s fraxis SRX e as well as sters eex so kelp will be a

completely neutral entity that serves its own interests and has its own tokenomics and pnl uh so as much as possible they will continue to be two separate entities okay all right so let's get into more kelp specific subjects uh what what would you say are the strengths of kelp how does it stand out from the many different LRT teams out there uh what's your guys's like strategy yeah uh it's a very interesting question and useful question in the current context of the competitive

environment U so some of the like based on our experience so far the biggest Focus areas or strategies that we will employ with kelp is one creating access for reaking what I what I mean by that is like we need to take reaking to where users already are that is when we can potentially scale this to like 10 20 maybe 30 billion right which we have seen what happened with staking with Lio and some of the largest validators of

the world so creating access for users is going to be top priority for us and that is where we uh can attract capital in the right way and also the right set of capital that is more stickier than some of the mercenary Capital out there so that's one most important strategy the second uh critical strategy for us is going to be having majority of the defi Integrations which is where we are really Bridging the Nexus between reaking and defi today both of them

compete with each other for the same amount of ethereum or Capital so the pmf for us for kelp is going to be when there is real utility created for Kelps RS among some of the largest D5 platforms so that people can actually borrow using RS or people could participate in PS using RS collateralize it for some other use case so that is where we believe we have solved a real user problem uh so those are the two

most important competitive modes in the long run and also that is where we'll spend disproportionate time and efforts okay so the the strategy here is that uh if you want to restake with kelp Dow one of the main benefits is that you will also be able to take your kelp Dow eth and then take that capital and put it back into Defi and do the thing you were already doing with your Ethan defi just now with the the kelp out e is that kind of the idea yep yep of course cool and what is the kelp out eth token it's

called RS eth restak eth okay so in terms of like a brand perspective like just having restak eth I actually think is like pretty valuable like Lio has St eth staked eth like easy and so you guys have RS eth uh maybe you guys just like got there first maybe the the playing field was open but just like I do think there's like some benefit just having like we are restak eth we have RS e yeah that's that was that was very easy to come up with in

hindsight okay beautiful uh talk about a little bit under the hood of kelp Dow uh who is doing the validating nodes like who is actually doing like running the hardware or doing the actual like um uh eth layer one like validation is there native reaking talk about the kelp system under the hood absolutely so just uh zooming out about the kelp product today so far we have been Prim primarily accepting lsts as deposit assets on kelp so there is no validators yet that are

live on igen layer that take uh lsds and validate uh but soon which is probably in two to three days we are also launching native reaking on kelp to which is we okay so that means it's out by the time this episode is released so this is now a live product yeah absolutely so we will have uh Native reaking live and some we're talking to some of the top validator and going to onboard them okay are you able to share who you're talking to uh it's still

confidential okay uh what about just like anyone entering into kpow with their validator is this are you going to be able to open this up or what's the strategy around there that's a very interesting question uh for context Stater allows any type of node operator to actually participate in validating nodes with Just 4 e worth of capital that is the permissionless way of uh operating validators so we do have uh permissionless we do have the opportunity to allow permissionless

validators to take part in kelp but the constraint that we face today is we do not know the uh slashing and penalty restrictions that some of these avss are going to impose so coming up with a collateral that is required or sufficient enough to cover for this slashing risks is an unknown today so while we'll have that use case uh in the future but at this stage it's a little premature to allow anybody because that that means we're putting users Capital

At Risk uh like we said by the time this episode goes out kelp will have announced native reaking what is on the near-term road map that is worth highlighting yeah so uh there are a few uh most important aspects that we working on uh in the same theme of creating access for users we are taking reaking natively live on some of the l2s uh working with a couple of Partners there who can offer native reaking for uh uh kelp Dow on l2s directly so users

don't have to bridge their assets back to main net and restake uh this is uh first of its kind and I think it is going to save a lot of gas fees and effort for users so L2 expansion is uh the most important thing that we focusing on apart from creating Dy opportunities we already have our $15 million in LP pools across Ford Deus uh soon getting to 40 million and then that opens up a lot of lending Market Integrations and CDP protocol Integrations that users can uh access uh

those are the two things and then apart from that obviously uh under the same theme of access working with Ledger and several other wallet Partners to have uh reaking uh right where users are using their uh platforms okay so just taking the same relationship that you built a stater uh instead of hey stake with Stater via Ledger you are saying hey restake with kelp via Ledger Y is a partnership that is underway yep yep absolutely and the

third most important thing that we are uh focusing on is actually creating some uh Pro creating some interesting products and use cases for avss because those uh so the avss are going to be a very important and critical part of the igen layer ecosystem so we've been running some experiments and problem solving with a few avss on some of their requirements like some some avss want triple staking they want to stake their governance token use that as a security

and their Partners governance token use that as security along with I security so all of these interesting use cases are uh coming up during our conversations and learnings with the avss so focusing on that and soon we'll probably see some interesting products coming out of that stream as well beautiful on if people are peaked about kelp Dow and they want to learn more where should they go uh so they should just simply log into kelp dow. XYZ uh you can find all information about uh kelp Dow smart

contracts are security which is the most important thing uh along with uh option to stake or restake your assets beautiful where did the name kelp come from uh kelp is this uh algae that powers this entire underwater ecosystem and uh we believe reaking is going to be such ecosystem which is Rich and and uh supports a lot of daps and applications so hence the name Kel we be

to be here thanks for opportunity David Daniel I think swell might be the earliest the oldest of all of these projects you came onto the world of staking first before liquid reaking uh talk about the beginnings of swell the inspiration to build swell and then we'll get into the the pivot into lrts yeah absolutely um yeah so just a quick background on myself my name is Daniel I'm the founder as well um originally my background's been a mix of like Finance technology and Innovation

and then um really went down the crypto Rabbit Hole um a little after the um sort of ethereum Ico um went into sort of a reading of austri Economics trying to understand Central Banking in one thing led to another and then into Bitcoin into ethereum then into defi um in terms of the original inspiration uh for swell saw an opportunity in late 2021 early 2022 to do something in what I thought would be one of the most powerful cryptoeconomic derivatives which was the LST um I thought it would

be the thing that would really take defi to the next level to have a yield bearing instrument backed by you know ethereum sort of consensus mechanism um and then yeah put together a seed round and then um was often away uh from there and then we launched uh our LST uh in early 2023 and then um basically saw um some good traction there um got up to about 100 million in tvl and then um saw the writing on the wall when uh reading the IG layer white paper and seeing that

look the what what what the lsts did for defi the lrts are going to do in a much bigger way um if the meta model sort of like you have this yeld bearing instrument um powering defi as a baselayer asset well El is sort of like a double plus yield bearing instrument powered by this new sort of ecosystem of upcoming AVS as an N layer and then it made sense for swell then to really triple down on that yeah the timing I think was pretty interesting for you guys because you guys like you said you guys were going to build an LST but then you were pretty

like fortuitous in in the way in when Igan layer uh was born if you will uh to for then you be able to like take that advant all of the deposits into the LST version of swell and turn that into the LRT version of swell talk about that transition because I think that is what swell is currently going through uh talk about the transition from LST to LRT and like the logistics behind all that yeah absolutely I'd say like generally speaking we're still sort of earlyish in the like evolution of lrts generally I

think that LRT design will continue to shake out as IA moves through its various stages in this road map um with stage two stage three or M2M 3 respectively um and so far as like swell is concerned um one of the biggest Integrations from the LST perspective was always to get the LST accepted as reaking collateral on IG layer that was a big unlock for us when Ian L did decide to expand its um Universe of LST collaterals to be accepted and then um

throughout that entire time we were building a very strong community that was passionate not only about liquid staking but also this new phenomena of liquid reaking and so when I did open those caps initially we saw a massive influx of people um basically looking to uh get exposure to reaking and we're in the middle of this um incentive campaign with our voyage and it made a lot of sense for people to um effectively Farm both swell pearls and N layer points too um and then um we recently launched about two weeks ago um our own native uh

L called rwe um arwe is effectively a mechanism for people to get um uncapped exposure to ig layer points in a way that's um has the underlying validators natively restate um so this is the current sort of State of Affairs at the moment with swell um we're currently undergoing um the development of rwe B2 and what rwe B2 will enable is is not only the acceptance of native eth at the underlying but also um LST such as sweet and that will sort of um be a really

important step to us eventually hoping to unify some meaningful percentage of restake liquidity on igon layer for utilization in defi um with maximum composability and optionality for resters beautiful and that's when SW will become like one unified system and be able to to uh inject all of its liquidity from its LST into its LRT uh so like bringing the advantage of being early into the uh into the world of native of reaking right MH exactly right beautiful um okay what is what would you say is the competitive Advantage uh of

swell what does swell bring into the world of lrts that is like what's your guys's strategy yeah absolutely I think the I think just generally in terms of from an advantage perspective I think the fact that we spent a lot of time thinking about ethereum staking like on the beacon chain side at first principal level for such a long time is a competitive advantage and also like our understanding of def5 which is in some ways one3 of the total like LRT um sort of spectrum if you think about in terms

of the beacon chain Defi and then everything onon layer so we have the beacon chain and D ready to go and I think everyone's sort of starting at the similar point in time um as regards IG trying to figure out okay how does this thing actually work where where are the risks where are the like how does the rewards work and where are the opportunities and how does one best position themselves to win the market um so i' say like that's firstly the advant Ag and I think um from like a legacy standpoint or from An Origin standpoint um moving forward though um I think in terms of our approach there's been

really three key things that we've really focused in on um as as regards our design for an lit protocol um the first thing is really um advocating for an ecosystem first approach so swells you um effectively um created a liquid restating Council that comprises um some of the best um operators and most promising avss on a ler so we have folks like layer there witness chain Inon P2 and a whole host of others as well and having them be part and parcel of the c-building process means that the LRT

that we will build out and continue to iterate on will be purpose built for those ecosystem actors within ion layer because it's all about trying to like match up across the OPD mechanism between resters operators and avss um the second thing as well in addition to the ecosystem approach is also having a real focus on risk um and so part of that um we've been working together with with um like the AR lab's team directly and also um with various risk experts including chaos and Gauntlet as regards things like ABS selection um pricing um

underwriting and these sorts of things um so that we're um going in with eyes wide open as regards sort of risk return and these sorts of things um and the final thing for us is really just about trying to drive as much value um to the underlying L as possible um and so being early to these sorts of collaborations and then driving you know the rewards um and passing them through um to our rakers and also exploring ways in which we might be able to ver vertically integrate some of this stuff so looking at okay not only what like what's an LRT

ultimately it's it's a liquification of restake liquidity but then what else can you do on top of that could you create things like a sort of a proof of restake um L2 restake roll up and then pass through the revenues to the LRT like these sorts of things that we're sort of constantly ideating on which is like really a part of like this well core contributor DNA is to you think about these sorts of things beautiful that was that was a lot wow um um one of the things that you touched on is about just making sure managing risk while also integrating with the avss right and kind of the idea that I've had about lrts

it's all about maximizing exposure to yields while minimizing risk right like how much extra uh yield can you get while making sure that you never ever get slashed um do you have any like sort of strategy or or plan around this yeah yeah I I think that like generally speaking the the strategy is really about um trying to quantify and qualify um what operators to work with and also what ABS is as well that those um operators will be opting into and then understanding um not only how those

interact but also like the underlying assets of the reaking pool itself um and so a lot of that is just going to be like constant dialogue with the operators and the abss as well and then being able to feed into these uh models and then applying governance and interventions where necessary particularly um in the na stages of the technology much in the similar way that IG has approached it um um with their committees with their multi- with their um Step through in terms of um sort of opening up gradually through guarded

launch um liquidity getting battle tested Audits and and these sorts of things so yeah it's definitely multifaceted approach as regards um risk what are you guys are working on right now like what is on the the near-term road map for swell uh and then just overall what what would you say in the swell Community are people excited about yeah definitely um I think the the the key new term things that we're working on is um our te um so we're getting busily ready for that um the other thing is um governance and like Dow operations which will come

part of the um token U being live um we've got a flow of defi Integrations as well that we want to have um for our L including um supporting that with various oracles and whatnot um and also some cross chain plans too uh in terms of what the communities um most excited about I'd say it's it's it's a token um so yeah uh surpris yeah so I want to make that as successful as possible um and yeah just um keep keep growing the protocol and keep providing

as as best as we can the um really seamless and easy to use reaking experience since uh well you guys have been around for a while because like again you guys did the LST before even like reaking was even a thing uh and so you guys have grown a community uh which I think is one of the uh kind of unique things of SW you guys have actually had the time to collect a bunch of people who are now uh what do you call them swelling swellers SW uh swellers yeah uh and so like talk talk about the growth of the the swell Community what's the vibe of swell culture yeah I think the

the vi swell culture is um I think a lot of people wanted the restating it like early and we told them look we can't get into the first one we didn't we didn't make it to the first White list but we'll be there for the second one so I think um the SW community's really invested in um reaking I think they're really invested in defi I think we have a quite a crypto native um and Def Savvy user base um we've got Circ um you know 100,000 stakers or or unique depositors at the moment um if even if you were to sort of like take out some of the like potential like gaming or sibling I think

it's still a very strong um Community um so um yeah I think people are really excited about reaking to be honest beautiful if people want to go and open up like the the technical documents or just read a higher level uh landscape about swell where should they go yeah they just go to our websites SW network. and then yeah just jump into the doc section and then uh and if you have any questions feel free to jump to the Discord teams always happy to answer any questions and take on any feedback uh what about uh you Daniel where can they follow you um yeah you could just follow

me on U on Twitter uh my handle's Daniel swore beautiful and we we'll get all those links in the show notes Daniel thank you so much thank you so much David appreciate your time bankless Nation I'm here with Lucas kazinski of Renzo Lucas welcome to the show David thanks for having us excited to talk about Renzo and what we're up to hell yeah let's talk a little bit about you first uh who are you how did you come to be at Renzo what's your like quick crypto background so I've been in the space full-time since 2018 uh first

joined the tesos foundation then was with a company called tokensoft and then a founding contributor to a project named moonwell which is a lending protocol earlier uh over the summer uh summer of 2022 uh a group of us uh got together and started just brainstorming about how igen layer is going to play out um some of the challenges and what we realized was that there was a need for two things

uh uh a product that could uh align incentives very well both on users that are trying to stake and uh ABS is trying to get those stakers and somebody that uh a team that had experience on managing risk and um has been around in the space for a long time so so we pulled together uh a small team uh this is June July uh of last summer and started building Renzo in August

beautiful and how did the team come together who did you how did this team form who are the other Founders and team members yeah so the contributing uh Founders to Renzo we all know each other so uh there's three of us uh James and cic um I was a portfolio company for cic when he was at a fund named Woodstock and James previously co-founded tokensoft so when I worked uh at tokensoft for two years uh I reported directly to him so what you essentially

have is three founding contributors that have a technical background heavy research Quant background and a growth operations uh uh background uh across the crypto space for the last six seven years so beautiful let's go into a little bit of that realization that you had about just the aligning of the incentives between the users the liquidity and the avss uh I really like that um as an entrance Point let's just

keep keep going down that conversation shed a little bit more light about just like the problem that you identified and wanted to help tackle yeah so when you look at igen layer and you take a step back there's a lot of noise right now around points and everything else but at its core IG layer has abss as you've guys done a really good job explaining what they are um and there services that um other projects are going to be using mostly

rollups and there's this really nice uh cycle that where uh Renzo is able to help complete and what I mean by that is abss have clients and those clients are rollups those rollups are going to use abss and they need security and that security has to come from from somewhere and there's a lot of complications uh not complications but complexity built into uh igen layer CU it's it's a

Marketplace it's a free Marketplace to attract those users and make it very simple for them to have an on an offramp into igen layer is really important for an ecosystem to thrive you need both parts of the supply and demand of the marketplace to come together so um there's this issue right now where um igen layer is attracting rollups to use them but rollups so we're talking like arbitrum optimism base the

same services that are being used in the adding value it's actually sucking liquidity out of those ecosystems so Renzo is positioned in a way where we're actually aligned incentives with those rollups l2s and l1s and the avss so that the value could also remain on those networks and the reason we're able to do that is uh how we designed Renzo from the very beginning so this past week we

introduced uh our next feature which we launched with just native reaking Renzo is the first protocol that is actually able to take native reaking and lsts and use them as collateral to have one LRT and the reason that's really important is where we're seeing other players having to do things like vampire attack uh other networks to be able to bring that funnel in Renzo is directly aligned with those ecosystems so one of

the Partnerships that we announced was B&B so uh in a few weeks here BMB users are actually going to be able to come to Renzo on B&B chain deposit uh be eth and get easy eth back on that chain so it completes this Loop uh same thing with arbitrum we announced a partnership with uh arbitrum and connects using connects as the the bridge layer users on arbitrum are going to be able to deposit uh eth Native

eth get easy eth back and the tvl stays on that chain and that same tvl is securing the same services that igen layer is uh essentially offering to rollups okay I I really like this so we have capital on these rollups mainly eth usually eth um stem Stables too but ignoring the Stables uh and what you're saying is that if you you can either put your eth in igen layer or you can put it on the layer to and so right now this thing there's a tension here because any

Capital that goes into igen layer is pulling away from liquidity and Defi and so Renzo is trying to actually complete this circuit is when and so when you put it into the specifically the Renzo LRT then you actually that Capital gets immediately turn returned back to the ecosystem in the layer two is this are you natively minting easy eth easy eth is Renzo those uh liquid uh restak token uh so this is your guys's particular one is e eth natively minted on each of

these layer twos or how does that actual uh flow how does it actually flow back to the layer two yeah so your spot on we're trying to close this Loop because what's happening right now that tvl has to get bridged back to main net and the rollups are losing their their tvl uh their users want access to ig layers so we are going to provide that um Easy E will be natively minted on each of these l2s and the nice thing is it's not just native e but also if that L2 has their

own LST you're able to actually deposit both into Renzo and get one LRT token back so the fungibility and the user experience is much better because you're not fragmenting liquidity so that's like a mantle eth for example is that is that kind of the what you're alluding to exactly so like if you uh if you look at mantle me e could get dep posi in to Renzo on mantle you get easy be uh easy eth back on mantle but if they also have

native eth you could also put that into Renzo and you still get easy eth back and the reason that's really important it it seems like this um slight differentiation but the fungibility of a token is so important because for a user to have a good experience when we say good experience to actually be able to use defi properly you need to have deeply liquidity on dexes the more tokens that you have lrts kind of representing it you're fragmenting it and the user experience becomes really

bad and then essentially you start compounding what the Integrations could be whether it's a lending protocol an aggregator uh a per platform the deeper the liquidity the the better um experience that users have being able to use that uh asset okay so the strategy here from Renzo is you guys are just using layer twos as like your top of capital funnel into the Renzo liquid reaking protocol um is that uh is are there any other tricks of your guys this

leave or is that the main differentiator or like what else would you like to bring onto the table here yeah so uh we're starting off with main net so today you could go bouncer uni V3 curve pool there's a pendal pool and there's a couple other Integrations in the pipeline and then we're branching out to create the funnel um a bigger funnel for users to be able actually access uh igen layer and we're the only ones that have those insign uh incentives perfectly aligned uh the other piece that is super

important and we're going to start hearing about this a lot more as igen layer da and IG layer mainten that comes a little bit closer all the frenzy right now is on points and uh these defi Integrations but where our team is actually focused so there's 11 people now contributing to to Renzo we're doing all these things but at the same time we're spending uh a ton of time aligning on the risk management and

how abss are going to be captured uh and what we mean by that is it's a huge coordination effort between operators and abss to safely and efficiently be able to get capital and then return those rewards that are getting generated by av's back to the users and that sounds very simple but there's quite a bit of complexity that's built in there um and not everybody's going to be able

to capture uh those rewards so for example we see points right now on lrts to be able to attract users and capital um we think that's going to actually get shifted down towards avss because you're going to have new abses that launch that can't pay uh stakers an eth right they don't have any anybody using them but they're trying to attract capital and Sal for the cold star problems so what are they going to do they're going to incentivize in either points or their

native token so thinking about these things and making sure that you have a protocol that not only accepts native eth but is also able to um collect erc20 tokens as rewards and efficiently return those to the users that's where you start getting this risk return uh optimal strategy that that we're we're building within Renzo beautiful beautiful okay uh Lucas

uh what is near-term on the road map that you want to to highlight what is getting users excited about Renzo yeah the the biggest thing is uh essentially what we're talking about right now so in a couple weeks here you're going to see uh Renzo launch On arbitrum and On B&B chain um and in the coming weeks you're going to see a half dozen other L2 announcements come out uh whether it's bass uh whether it's medic whether it's

scroll there's a lot of conversations going on with uh uh uh lanaa and bringing all these people to and all these ecosystems really to igen layer right so Renzo is becoming this settlement layer um and in order to be able to do that um we also have to uh take into consideration how risk is managed on the protocol one last question before we tie this off here what about becoming a

validator in the Renzo system is this a closed is it open what is the future of that look like yes so the the way Renzo is going to Market uh it's following a similar Playbook that you saw Lio do uh a few years ago where there's a smaller set of operators but they're extremely high quality so right now figment and PP are the two uh validators that are staking and will be reaking uh the the

assets deposited on Renzo and over time you'll see us decentralize that operator set the reason that's really important is you want a highquality operator from a security standpoint securing these avss because every single ABS is different and the operator has different requirements to be able to secure them um and the coordination effort to secure something very new is extremely high so you'll see maybe three to five operators

uh in the early days and then over time will'll decentralize as Things become more um more easier and uh less risky sure beautiful Lucas uh if people are peaked about Renzo where should listeners go to find out more yeah just uh go to renzop protocol.com um you could restate directly from mainnet it's literally one click super easy um that's we try to make it easy with easy eth

beautiful awesome all those L will be available in the show us Lucas thank you so much for joining me thanks Dave for having us
