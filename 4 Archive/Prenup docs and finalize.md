### High Level Goals
1. Make sure in the unlikely event of separation, we are not scrambling to get legal involved and cost both parties hundreds of thousands of dollars
2. Make sure we agree on something that seems "fair" early on--the definition of fair is subjective, so need to put objective measures there
3. Make sure our companies are not at risk because of any disagreement between us. In particular:
	1. The control of the shares will only be passive, from both exercise and transfer perspective
	2. The other party won't be able exercise voting rights or expect a board seat and the nature of the shares will just be monetary
	3. When selling the shares, they will use good faith and disclose to the owning party that they will be exercising in a month explicitly detailing the deal terms and the other entity. The owning party (and their investors) will have the right of first refusal
	4. No corporate liabilities can be attributed to the other person (and no personal liabilities to the companies)
	5. The other party won't have any rights on the corporate assets (other than the share ownership)
4. Figure out how we want to structure our during-marital fianances
	1. money-in: from our basic salary incomes, gifts
	2. personal and joint expenses
		1. 100% money goes into the joint account
		2. OR xx% of that goes to "personal" account
			1. is this necessary?
			2. do we expect we would have disagreement in-terms of what 
	3. money-out: expenses (shared expenses)
	4. investments
5. disclose what we own and owe
6. figure out how to deal with the real estate properties
7. Ability to attribute assets to a trust fund
8. No matter what, if we have kids, need to ensure that they are getting the best quality of life and support. Especially:
	1. Help w/ school and other expenses
	2. Help w/ day to day expenses
9. How do you figure out child support:

### Some math
Imagine by the end of the marriage husband accumulated h* and wife amount w* (on their name), and accumulated hc and wc amount of company shares AND their joint account balance is J. They had h and w net amount (pre marriage, defined as follows:
	h = total gross asset of husband - total liabilities of husband

Then the total asset in contention (unless otherwise described), is
	T = J + h* + w* - h - w

Now this T amount asset needs to be divided in the following way (discuss w/ habibe for proposed changes)
1. if the marriage ends without kids
	1. H* = h + T x 50%
	2. W* = w + T x 50% 
2. If it ends with kids:
	1. 1 kid:
		1. H* = h + 40% T
		2. W* = w + 40% T
		3. Kid = 20% T
	2. 2 or more kids:
		1. H* = h + 30% T
		2. W = w + 30% T
		3. Kids total = 40% T

#### Version w/ primary occupation equity / token consideration

1.  if the marriage ends without kids, but 5- years
	1. H* = h + T x 50% + hc x 80% + wc x 20%
	2. W* = h + T x 50% + hc x 20% + wc x 80%
2. if the marriage ends without kids, but 5+ years
	1. H* = h + T x 50% + hc x 70% + wc x 30%
	2. W* = h + T x 50% + hc x 30% + wc x 70%
3. If it ends with kids:
	1. 1 kid:
		1. H* = h + 40% T + hc x 60% + wc x 20%
		2. W* = w + 40% T + hc x 20% + wc x 60%
		3. Kid = 20% T + 20% x (hc + wc)
	2. 2 or more kids:
		1. H* = h + 30% T + hc x 55% + wc x 15%
		2. W = w + 30% T + hc x 15% + wc x 55%
		3. Kids total = 40% T + 30% x (hc + wc)



### Proposal For Habibe

### Questions
1. Broadly speaking what is marital property and what is not?
2. How do we want the cash and other liquid / semi liquid assets to be divided? Think in terms of no kid, 1kid, 2 or more kids
3. How do we want to have the shares / equity of the companies divided? Do we include our current companies? What about voting rights and controlling power?
4. How would you figure out a child support amount?
5. Is there any spousal support involved?

		3. Kid = yy% T
	2. 2 or more kids:

	2. W* = h + T x xx% + hc x zz% + wc x yy%
2. If it ends with kids:

		2. W* = w + xx% T + hc x zz% + wc x yy%

	2. 2 or more kids:
		1. H* = h + xx% T + hc x yy% + wc x zz%
		2. W = w + xx% T + hc x zz% + wc x yy%
		3. Kids total = xx% T + yy% x (hc + wc)



## Steps
1. Discuss with the legal what can be done
2. Discuss with Habibe and have her retail a legal counsel
