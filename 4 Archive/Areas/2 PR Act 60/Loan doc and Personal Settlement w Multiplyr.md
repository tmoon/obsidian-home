Loan doc:


1. Total loan: 450K
2. Receivables: (150K, 175K, 190K base)
	1. June-Dec 2021: $45,917.79, 87.5. Debt: 41582.21
	2. 2022: $66,916.83, 175K. Debt: 108083.17
	3. 2023: 190K
	4. D21 + D22 + D23 = 340K
3. So by the end of 2023,  I owe the company: 110334.62
4. Had crypto?
 

### Crypto Math
1. Long term gain
	1. Sold BTC at 46,311.74 
	2. base 9604.5
2. Short term gain
	1. Sold ETH at 3769.3 
	2. base: 
	3. +1 +.5+2 = 3.5 + 5.5 = 9 ETH
3. Transactions:
	1. Sold 9ETH on Jan 1, 2022
	2. Sold ~.5BTC on Jan 1, 2022

### Steps
1. Figure out how much I have taken loan (450K) = L
2. Minus all the crypto, I plan to have "loaned" to them = C (~60K)
3. Effective loan, EL = L - C (~390K)
4. Now the debt for years, D21, D22, D23 (~340K)
5. Remaining loan = EL - D21 - D22 - D 23 (~50K)


### 2024 math
1. Comp 190K
2. the company now owes me 140K
