## Archive Philosophy

**Archive ≠ Delete**

**Delete:** Never need this again, no value
**Archive:** Done with it now, might reference later

Archive is:
- A completed project you're proud of
- A decision trail (why we abandoned X)
- Historical reference (how we solved Y before)
- Peace of mind (it's not lost, just dormant)

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**Archive aggressively. Most people archive too late, not too early.**

If a project hasn't moved in 30 days, it's dead weight. Archive it. You can always restore if priorities change.

Your Archive folder has 505 files - that's GOOD. It means you've shipped things, completed work, made progress. An empty Archive means you're not executing.

**Founder anti-pattern:** Keeping zombie projects active "just in case." This creates decision debt.

If it's not moving the needle THIS month, archive it. Clear mental space for what matters now.

Your Day Planner Archive is your execution history. Don't delete these - they're proof of work and learning material for patterns.

**Archive liberally. Delete conservatively. Execute ruthlessly.**

*The Archive is where good work rests after serving its purpose.*
