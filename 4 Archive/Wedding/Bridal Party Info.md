Hey: Excited to have you for at the wedding! 

These are the rough timeline and activities:

11am: Bride and groom arrive at the palace (no action on your side, but do get brunch early and get ready)
Between 1pm-2pm (after your lunch): arrive at Adile Sultan Palace) and join the groom to the groom's room for drinking and hanging out. As requested, ideally black tie attire--we are getting some scarfs for the men (and one lady who wears headscarf) and the wedding organizer will give you a "wedding boutonniere" (flower) to put on top of the pocket square and on hand for the ladies.
3:30pm: Bride-groom sees each other for the first time and takes photos (you guys can continue hanging out as this is just couple's photos).
4:30pm: Family photo time
4:55pm: Bridal Party and Grooms Party come to the courtyard for photos
5:00pm: photos with the Bridal Party and Grooms Party
5:30pm: Some of you guys join the family to welcome guests and some stay at the courtyard to hang out and welcome other guests. Habibe and Tarik heads for their first dance rehearsal and sound check
6:00pm: cocktail bars open
6:15pm: come to the entryway to get ready and line up for the wedding procession
6:20pm: wedding procession starts
6:30pm: wedding procession starts and everyone stands by the podium
6:37pm: bride enters the courtyard
6:40pm: officiant starts the welcome and his speech
6:45pm: vows
6:55pm: officiant does the marriage ceremony
7:00pm: bridge and groom exits and you help direct everyone into the gala ballroom, where everyone has their seatings assigned
7:15pm: second entrance of bride and groom and first dance
7:30pm: dinner course starts + other entertainment
9:30pm: DJ starts their first set
10:30pm: dessert served and DJ starts ramping up the music
11:00pm-11:30pm: we need to put the elderly to their transports and we continue the after party
12-1pm: party snacks and other food served
2am: end of afterparty, head to the villa / hotel




Hey all: super excited to have you all in a week or so--we just did our walkthrough and menu tasting yesterday and everything is looking great! In the meantime here are some thoughts:  
1. Flu shots and other health measures: Both Habibe and I got flu a week ago, so we STRONGLY recommend you take flu shot AND wear a mask during your travel. The doctors mentioned that the flu and other respiratory diseases are running wild and early this year. So to make sure you are at the best shape to enjoy two full days of festivities + visiting exciting places around Istanbul, please make sure to take best measures before the travel. Also, this year Istanbul is running a little hotter than usual, so during your travel and stay, stay extra hydrated  
2. Immigration at the airport is super easy, but make sure to have your evisa ready before you land (takes 5mins to get online). That's probably the only thing they will ask for  
4. Re: general transportation, taxis from the airport is the easiest and the best (but please make sure to take some Lira for the taxis, in case they dont take card). Taxis should run 40-50 USD equivalent lira to your accommodations. Separately, you can get taxis using Uber and BiTaksi apps, I would recommend downloading both, just in case
5. Hopefully all of your have your accommodation detail set, if anything changed, please update your RSVP here: https://partiful.com/e/LbFwCWllbPyMzIg8I3mu  (we will be sending our final version of seating + dietary restrictions tomorrow, super important the RSVP piece is updated)
6. We are trying to get some extra booze for the week and you can grab one 1L liquor at the airport at the duty free, would appreciate if you could bring a bottle of hard liquor / esp whiskey from the duty free / from the states on your way in. The wedding will offer unlimited Turkish wine--so please take advantage of that. We will also setup whiskey and cigar bars at the smoking areas
