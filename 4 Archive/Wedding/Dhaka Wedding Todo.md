### feedback

Good
1. Overall the event went fairly smoothly, no unforeseen logistical issues from the decoration, lights or coordination with the artists
2. It was relatively easy to communicate our requirements and explain what we want
3. We got close to the design we wanted
4. The three stage design was excellent and we appreciate making proper stage for ghashforing (which they also loved). This is very unconventional but in general it flowed well
5. Small details like the box at the entrance, small touches on decor was done well 


Not so great
1. The wooden main stage of golf club was not in good shape, it communicated earlier we could have discussed covering it with pvc. We ended up finding a patchy solution of putting some white pvc, which turned out ok
2. Generally there are some cleanliness issues with the venue and the carpet was not very clean / did not look like what we wanted. Habibe was not happy about it
3. My mom was unhappy with no flower with the pathway of green leading to main stage, but again we did not put it on budget
4. One big thing was the truss was not as heavy as we expected to be (and basically it was not close to the photo that we shared). Was basically expecting fuller and a bit lower lying truss 

 
But at the end everyone loved the overall design, we had a lot of fun with the cultural events and dances and music. So, you know—very happy overall, minus some minor hiccups.


### Todo
1. Find a makeup artist that is near our house / in Banani
