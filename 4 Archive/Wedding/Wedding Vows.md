Standing at the altar, I find myself reminiscing about the adventurous journey Habibe and I have shared. Our stories range from ambitious European tours to an unexpected drone flight over Sumela Monastery that drew a bit too much attention! One memory that stands out is our 2019 adventure in Uludag, Bursa. Amidst a blinding snowstorm, Habibe became my guiding compass. But it's not just the grand escapades that matter; it's the everyday moments that truly resonate with me. The quiet mornings filled with Habibe's laughter, the passion in her eyes, and our shared silences have deepened my love for her. I fondly recall the day we met in San Francisco, where I was enchanted by an ambitious Uyghur-Turkish girl with the dream to shake the world! As we embark on this new chapter, I promise to cherish our love daily, recognizing its challenges but always acknowledging its worth.




Nikah yeminimi yapmak için Habibe ile paylaştığımız maceralı yolculuğu düşünüyorum. Hikayemiz, iddialı Avrupa turlarından Sumela Manastırı üzerinde beklenmedik bir drone uçuşuna kadar uzanıyor; bu uçuş belki de fazlasıyla dikkat çekmişti! 2019’da Bursa Uludağ’daki Habibe’nin benim yol göstericim olduğu kör edici bir kar fırtınası hala aklımdadır. Ancak sadece bunun gibi büyük maceralar değil, günlük anılarımız da benim için gerçekten önemli. Habibe’nin sabahlarımı doldurduğu kahkahaları, gözlerindeki tutku ve paylaştığımız sessiz anlar, ona olan sevgimi derinleştirmiştir. San Franscisco’daki o dünyayı sallamak isteyen iddialı bir Uygur-Türk kızına ilk karşılaştığımız gün hayran kaldım. Bu yeni bölüme atılırken, her gün sevgimizi değerli kılmayı, zorluklarını tanımayı ve bu zorlukların değerini her zaman kabul edeceğimi vaat ediyorum.

Habibe,

Standing here at Adile Sultan Palace, surrounded by loved ones from every corner of the world, I'm enveloped by memories of our shared journey, a journey that's been nothing short of an adventure. We have shared crazy stories together--from trying to tour 27 European cities in 15 days to that one time when us trying to fly a drone over Sumela Monastery had the Turkish military send a platoon of Army on our tails!

Or remember that time on March 15, 2019 in Uludag mountains of Bursa? As a snowstorm enveloped us, our descent became a test of faith with zero visibility. In that blinding white, you became my only frame of reference, my anchor. It was a profound testament to how we've come to rely on each other in life's most challenging moments. Just as we found our way through that storm by leaning on each other, I vow to be your anchor, your constant, as we navigate the unpredictable journey of life together.

Yet, it's not just the grand adventures but the everyday moments that deepen my love for you--your laughter in the quiet mornings, the way your eyes light up when you're passionate about something, and the comfort of our silent moments. Or our shared memories cooking delicious hand-made noodles and hosting our friends. Our love has been a continuous discovery, and with each passing day, I'm reminded of the depth of my affection for you. I vividly remember the day I met you--an Uyghur-Turkish girl in San Francisco, with big dream to shake the world! I am confident that together, we will not only build a loving family but also create great things—something bigger than both of us.

From the homes we've built across two countries to the businesses we've nurtured, our story is a testament to your supportive nature. Your unwavering support has been my strength, and your giving nature, my inspiration. Even when miles apart, between Turkey and the USA, your love never wavered.
  
Today, I vow to you:
- To accept you for who you are, for all the beauty and brilliance, and equally for all the faults.
- To choose US, every single day. For us Love has never been easy, but it has been a conscious choice, and it's always been worth it
- To always cherish and honor your kindness, support, and generosity.
- To be there for you, as you've been for me, through every high and every low.
- To be your partner in every adventure, whether it's skiing, traveling, or simply enjoying a quiet evening at home.
- I finally vow to take you as my wife from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until parted by death.

As we embark on this next chapter, just like on that challenging ski slope, I promise to be your anchor. Here's to our past, our present, and a future filled with adventures, love, and unwavering support.
