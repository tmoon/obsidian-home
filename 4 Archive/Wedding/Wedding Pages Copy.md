### About Us

Our meet-cute was in 2017, at one of the hot-pot dinner parities arranged by a mutual friend. Habibe was visiting San Francisco for her Ycombinator interview and I was working on EDO. As luck would have it, we crossed our paths, connected instantly, and soon fell in love. 

Although separated by thousands of miles, we chose to weave our stories together, and the tapestry of our relationship grew richer with each passing year, and 6 years later, here we are! We travelled the world, ski'd in 3 continents, climbed some serious frozen waterfalls, but most importantly we have built homes both in the US and Turkey. 

As we stand on the threshold of the next chapter, we are filled with gratitude and excitement. We warmly invite you to join us in the grand celebration of our union and the beautiful tapestry of love and experiences that brought us to this moment.

Here are some photos for all of our friends and family about the journey we had together!
