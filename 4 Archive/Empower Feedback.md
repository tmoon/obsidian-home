1. Getting to the finding that people are not willing to deposit without a full banking product: we have been giving people cards since April (internally) and then since June externally and it has been 3 months and it is surprising that we are finding only now that people don't refill their cards and that they won't use the product without getting a full banking/depository account
	1. Suggestion 1: we are thinking through a the experimental design of a good null hypothesis early on and try to cut the time: esp here the hypothesis should not have been dependent on the total number of users, but explicitly on users who deposit + the spend amount (because those are the two major ways we plan to make money)
2. Not sufficiently prioritizing the integration: we always knew we had to integrate when we have enough customers, but related to point 1, we did not realize early on that having a legit integration is the only way for us to even test the hypothesis of PMF. 
	1. Suggestion / thought: how can we avoid this situation where we are completely stuck? I did mention many times that for these kind of integration, we need to look far ahead and start early, but somehow we were not able to 100% prioratize that
	2. +: I want to make sure we dont make the same mistake when it comes to interchange fee card product, series LLC and tax compliance stuff as well. One of us need to make sure we are sufficiently looking ahead and not getting stuck in these local blocking points.
