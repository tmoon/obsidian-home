### From his website
## About

Sankha finished his doctoral thesis applying machine learning to non-linear dynamical systems from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). He finished his finance degree from the Sloan School of Management at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/).

During his PhD he focussed on using supercomputing facilities available to [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) researchers, for the first time to simulate a [three-dimensional flag and derive its analytical constraints on stability](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/threedimensional-effects-on-flag-flapping-dynamics/A9E2A95E4193D8052AF56A612889D8B7) . During his PhD, Sankha published [10 peer review journals in the field of Turbulence incorporating computer graphics and invariant theory influencing multiple references](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14685240701506896?role=button&needAccess=true&journalCode=tjot20) from [NASA.](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010518-040547)

**Major papers:** [https://mit.academia.edu/SankhaBanerjee](https://mit.academia.edu/SankhaBanerjee).

Current passion is in designing event driven Systems for high-frequency market making. Sankha operates an inhouse event-driven liquidity-providing trading strategy at ultra-low latency while maintaining a relatively neutral position on the top crypto-exchanges and a major DEX. The plan is to release the whitepaper, and open-source the system for community development from like minded researchers and traders. Currently the code is used with some researchers from MIT and Harvard to investigate the effect of cancellations on market quality and the agent's profitability on crypto-exchanges.

First few years at [Castleton Commodities International](https://www.cci.com/) developing and implementing algorithms on electricity, commodity, forex, and interest-rate-derivative markets on NYSE/CME. Work in cryptocurrency started in 2014; focused on implementing a machine learning based real-estate valuation and buying of assets on [Algorand blockchain](https://algorand.com/) . Spent 3 years working as a fully systematic quant/trader at family offices, [Blue Ridge Investments](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blue-ridge-capital/) and [EastMore Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eastmore-group/) building a global macro book operating at 2.0 sharpe and 3% drawdown.

In 2017, moved to crypto full-time and spent a year building/executing the market-making algorithms for BITMEX/BINANCE on perp markets, becoming one of the top market makers with a $1 billion weekly volume. In 2020, was appointed the CEO of [Credence Limited](https://www.credencelimited.com/), given a 4 million dollar portfolio to invest in early stage L1 protocols focused on DeFi. The approach for portfolio construction was based on heavy infrastructure, codebase diligence, with specific focus on the [Cosmos Blockchain](https://cosmos.network/) .

Sankha contributed to the initial design of the arbitrage framework between the [BEP20 RUNE](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/thorchain-bep20/) and the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), leading him to become the lead investor of [Thorchain](https://thorchain.org/). Sankha has been focused on helping with the growth of DeFi the Cosmos ecosystem, with projects namely [Thorchain](https://thorchain.org/), [Band](https://bandprotocol.com/), [Kava](https://www.kava.io/), and [Akash](https://akash.network/) as seed investors from 2018. Currently, he is the protocol architect of NIBIRU (decentralized perpetual trading platform with its stablecoin and DEX) on Cosmos.


Goals of interview
1. learn about his ML experience
2. prod on his DEX background
3. Ask about hi thoughts on IL:
4. what does lead investor on thorchain mean?
5. What is nibiru?


### Interview Notes
1. Applied math and CS phd MIT
2. worked on market making and then worked on binance and other places
3. back in 2020, thorchain found him and worked w thorchain 
4. made him the biggest investor of thorchain 
5. done heavy cosmos SDK work
6. works w osmosis foundation
7. working on nibiru
8. had a little bit of separation from the team
9. Sunny: helping defi effort
10. solidity is not as good as cosm-wasm
11. likes to work on idea generation and project
12. involved w penoptic
13. was looking predominanty on ETH in 2016
	1. bitmax has convexity
	2. need to hedge btc convexity
14. what spread does it make sense to provide liquditiy
15. what did not like is binance has preferred friend
	1. DYDX was writing product and compound was getting integrated in that
16. in 2020, eth had the same idea but he gas was crazy
17. thats how the thorchain made sense
18. biggest diff in DeFi we found is composibity at scale
	1. one example of composibility is that can you get a large loan to scale up 
	2. penoptics


His vision:
1. sell the product the product as diversified ETF, include convexities from options and perps 
2. will take the last few years of data, simulate and try to sell to institutional
3. Then we will find what the affine market and find out the numbers from simulation 
4. want ti bring options and perp strategies 
5. at aggregate yield is low correlation
6. 200-400/hr
7. jsut to feel comfortable, can start w a 6mo engagement. if it is not workng we can negotiate. can have a monthly update
