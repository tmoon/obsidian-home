    Method v1, that I’m currently using for all my studies
    
    The video covers a learning method that involves having a well-defined curriculum, emotional resonance, attention, and repetition. The importance of having a curriculum that excites the learner and the need to create an environment with zero distractions for concentration is emphasized. The method includes recalling previously learned information before a learning session and focusing on understanding the material during the session. The importance of what happens in between learning sessions for long-term learning and retention is also discussed.

    The need for a method, the Ferrari of learning, overview of two methods
    
    The document discusses the need for a method to improve learning and outlines two versions of the method. The first version is designed for those who struggle with concentration and attention, while the second version is more advanced and suitable for those who are proficient in mental operations. The author compares the method to driving a car, where one doesn't need to understand how the car works to drive it. The document also refers to a popular online course on learning and provides references to the research and studies that informed the development of the method.

hi and welcome back to the course in this video I'm going to cover the learning method that I'm currently using and have been using for the past year or year and a half and in the next one I will go back in time and explain the method that I originally came up with that helped me keep my attention for longer help me extend my working memory a little bit all of those goodies related to mental abilities there is really three parts of this

video in the beginning I will explain why having a curriculum a well-defined curriculum that you're excited about is important then we're gonna go into the method itself and we will cover what is going on before the session and during the session that is going to be one thing and then the second one is going to be what is happening what you should be doing in between learning sessions

because if you think about it learning is all about those episodes of time when you're actively uploading information to the brain and sort of how people perceive learning as you know eating is a good analogy here learning is kind of like eating where you're putting food in your mouth and so on but in fact both in physical training for instance and in mental sort of training uh what we call learning the updates to the nervous system the actual

improvements the adaptations they happen long after the insult long after the insulted the technical term that people use to describe the exertion that we exert upon the system and so in physical training your muscles grow when you during recovery they don't grow like while you're training and by the same token when you're learning something your synopsis The Connections amongst neurons they grow kind of physically

actually they're little than bumps and they didn't read the spines that connect neurons in the brain they grow while you're resting primarily it's sleep but also while you're doing sort of other things and so this is the first important idea that I wanted to communicate is that people think of learning as you know the actual process when I grab a book and so if you ask someone to describe what learning is they would say that this is learning like I'm reading something

right but in fact learning is after I did the reading in the right way and then I put that thing away and what I'm doing in between this learning session and the next one that is where learning occurs and we're going to talk a lot about that so quick recap before we dive in why the curriculum is important what you do before and during the learning session and then what you do in between learning sessions sort of how you digest you know

the information and knowledge that you learn that's the outline let's jump into it so let's talk about why having a well-defined curriculum that you're excited about why is it important for good learning to occur for any learning to occur in fact because obviously the first reason is that if you don't have one you have to think of what to study when you either

feel like studying or when you got some time to do it or when you have you know your slot for studying and if you don't have a clear plan what you're going to do in that period of time then you have to think of that plan at that very moment and that's very hard for all sorts of reasons because humans aren't very good at you know building very complex things at one go we can approach that in iterative manner um that's why charge apt Is So Good by

the way because it allows you to do this sort of iterativity through multi-torn conversations and so obviously if you don't have this curriculum then yeah that's going to be a big trouble because then you'll be kind of trusting your feelings that's another important thing that you know usually our feelings um short-term do not really relate to what we want long term for instance long term I want to build businesses I want to

create interesting things I want to study and so on but short term I'll be like I don't know I kind of like feel like eating and watching a podcast and that may not necessarily be optimal for my long-term goals so without belaboring too much about it it's really important to have a predefined plan so that you don't have to think about all these things while you are supposed to be learning as their sacred time

the second reason why it's important is because having a really interesting curriculum the one that you care about the one that Sparks you know ignites a spark inside of you is crucial because one of the three things that are important for learning to happen is emotional resonance this is the model developed by scientists his name is Suzuki and it's a

pretty pretty famous Well published and there is three things that sort of she outlines as kind of important for Learning and that is emotional resonance that is attention there is a repetition we're going to talk about all of this but interestingly she highlights that you know when sometimes emotional resonance is so high that a zero shot learning can occur and she provides an example which was coming back to her apartment and she saw

her apartment door open cracked you know and there was a burglary in her apartment and that made a traumatic experience for her and that was a sort of a zero shot learning right and she kept recalling that experience over and over again as she was coming back to her apartment overnight um so she had eventually she had to move and she had to sort of work on that traumatic experience and so that is a negative example but there is a lot of

positive examples too where if you're interested in something that alters your brain state it Alters your ability to concentrate and kind of like lose yourself in this um almost metaphysical way you dissolve into the thing that you're doing and so if you don't have a Greek if you have a curriculum that's already good because you don't have to think about it but if you don't have a curriculum that you're really interested in and I hope you are interested in the course that you are currently studying then that's a

big trouble and I highly suggest you alter that curriculum because even if you think about it like if you think about things that you want to learn in a sort of um as a an array of five objects and there would be like you know physics math computer science and so on um up to five or six or so and you're not like super stoked about physics right now but you're really curious about math I would suggest you

kind of like rotate the two and you go off to math first because there you have a productivity multiplier your actual learning rate will be much faster so those are two simple ideas why having a curriculum is important in this course I hope that emotional resonance is already present and I sort of took the effort of Designing the curriculum for you so you scored two out of two but I hope that you apply this learning method to all sorts of things outside the

course that is in fact one of my goals and when you do so I highly suggest that you take the effort to First sort of score how excited you are about this about learning more about this and second develop a really well defined curriculum ideally by talking to someone who is an expert in the field that you're doing for instance it's kind of obvious in um let's say

um Sports and kind of performance and arts where learning is very well developed and learning methods and techniques for instance if you're going to study piano how to play piano there'll be no question what you need to be doing right there is like a framework and a whole path for the next 10 15 years you just need to put in the effort and that's sort of what you want to accomplish with learning anything unfortunately there is no such thing in many other disciplines if you want to learn entrepreneurship for instance it's

um kind of way more obscure than learning how to play piano in part because the activity is more let's say elaborate or it involves systems of systems and many different roles and external systems and so on but also in part because we just haven't kind of transferred the things that we know about learning about learning how to perform a sport or an art to these other things that we are teaching and practicing that's kind of weird so we'll

talk about that in the future too but quick recap having a curriculum is crucial in this course I designed it for you so you don't have to worry about that the only thing you have to worry about is that you are interested in learning about this and I hope you are now let's talk about what you need to do before and during the learning session it is important to keep in mind that learning sessions themselves when you

are reading or watching or whatever doing whatever you're doing to learn the thing are less important than what you do in between those sessions that's crucial to keep in mind but still they are necessary absolutely necessary because without this insult that we exert upon the nervous system no learning will occur

and so we can't do without them but we have to be mindful that they're not the whole thing the whole thing is much bigger it's about what you do in between the sessions still what we do before and during the learning session so for the psycho example let's imagine that I want to study this book I want to study this book I want to understand it I want to understand what it says what it means for me for the future of learning the future of

education and so on and the question is how do I actually do it that in fact is what the method is supposed to do right and if you ask this question most people they would say oh well I'm just going to read it like that's that's it that's that's how I learn it um but in fact that I would argue and the science shows that that is not the far far not not the most effective way to

get to acquire the and retain and sort of understand meaning integrate the information arm in this book so we're gonna have a more effective method very soon so what do you actually do what do you do when you have this resource and you want to study first of all it is crucial to ensure that you are in the right environment

so if you look around myself I have this little home office from which I work and this is a pretty good learning environment because it is calm it is aesthetically pleasing but most importantly it has zero distractions and as concentration is essential and fundamental for learning it is absolutely crucial to ensure that

before to intro before the session that you are in the environment where you can concentrate on whatever you're studying and that you will not be distracted sometimes that is hard to do sometimes you are in the library or in the train or whatnot when there is natural sort of stimuli potentially distraction stimuli and so in that case um you either you know postpone the

learning to the time where you are ideally alone or you adapt somehow for instance by using noise canceling headphones sort of calm soothing wordless music piano perhaps or some there is a wonderful playlist in Spotify called stress relief so this sorts of things that you kind of like adapt so that you can create this environment for

concentration I'm going to talk about concentration more but the interesting thing about concentration is that it's not like a switch right it also depends on the environment that you're in and no matter how good you are at concentrating it can be like a Buddhist monk or something but if I put you um on the Times Square it will look really hard to concentrate because of all this information that the brain is processing all this stimuli that is coming through all the senses and being

processed by the brain automatically you don't have to choose whether to process that or not you can selectively Focus your attention but the processing happens Beyond conscious awareness sometimes and it really affects our performance on learning so get the environment right that's the first and I don't know if that's the most important step but definitely a very very important one the next thing that you want to do before the learning session is to recall

what you have learned previously so suppose that I'm studying this book and obviously I'm reading it like in chunks not in one sitting that would be cramming and you don't want to do cramming and what I would do is for instance I like a lot I read you know 70 Pages or so and then I'm starting from this language highways section and what I would do before I sort of begin the learning session is to

close the book and ideally close my eyes I often do that because it helps me concentrate and helps me Aid my mental abilities you can do that with your eyes open by the way there is no you know ban on closing or open your eyes it's just a matter of preference and you want to concentrate on this book and everything that you have learned from it so far by this point so by Page 72 let's say if that's

where I'm at you want to concentrate on that and you want to recall this information proactively without having any prompt such as flashcard for instance with a sort of a question that you know sends a signal and then you retrieve that information this is the hardest form of active recall probably the most important learning tool and that is why you want to employ it just before you start the learning

session it also actually helps you to you know get the relevant information into the working memory so that then you can be you know like this um like someone who does the kneading you kind of like have all the threads and then you can interconnect them well if you have just one thread you know then the one that people can kind of like currently reading be much harder to interconnect there is nothing to interconnected with that's a very rough analogy so don't take it with a grain of

salt but I think it's a pretty accurate one so you want to concentrate on what you read previously close or keep your eyes open recall that information upload it to your working memory what I do is I kind of like try to that occurs naturally but I also try proactively to chunk it a little bit in chunking is the second important learning tool that you need to be aware of because when you charm confirmation when you you know there is five things

let's say we call them fingers right and then you chunk them together as in the concept of a finger that actually in neurobiologically diffracted in certain neural architecture called hubs where there is clusters of neurons put closer to each other physically connected to other ones other neurons and other neural circuits but chunking is crucial because when you recall something you kind of like send an Electra electrical signal through this

neural circuit and if there is a chunk then basically the whole chunk lights up the whole chunk excites or to a certain extent let's say let's put it this way so simply put chunking is crucial because if you chunk the information then you kind of interconnect all the components of a chunk and it's much easier to recall them than if you do so on our individual basis recall component of the component of the component of the

component and so on so when I do this pre-learning recall I close my eyes and I retrieve the information and I try to kind of like map it um and chunk it a little bit so you know I may have read about certain learning techniques I'll be like one chunk I may have read about the application of learning in the in the education industry there will be another chunker and so on so that's sort of the first thing that I do before I begin the

learning session and after I ensure that my environment is correct the next thing that I do is called picture walking and that is the invention of wonderful woman Barbara Oakley she came up with the term I'm merely copying it for this particular lecture and what it means is actually kind of like what it's said it means so you open the book and let's say again you finished it you know page 28 or so and then

you're probably going to read like for about 30 minutes you kind of know your reading pace and so on and you just go through the whole thing that you will likely read which is going to be about you know 10 pages or so and you just kind of quickly scan through it and see what what you kind of grasp in this immediate almost almost like walking through the pictures that's why it's called that way in this immediate way this is pretty helpful because it helps

you it helps your brain to build out the map of what it is about to learn you know usually good learning resources like this book and I hope this chorus are structured in a certain way and the reason why there are structured instead of just being a jumble of facts is because that structure again AIDS chunking and so when you're reading you know a chapter and a chapter has certain sections inside and each section has

subsections you kind of like can chunk it that way you can chunk it in many other ways but you can sort of kind of preview what the chunk is going to be and that preview is kind of like scaffolding on the building so when you're erecting a building first kind of put some skeleton and then you arm start the Cosmetics the Cosmetic works and that's sort of like that in learning so when you're learning so something you

kind of do this picture walk and it helps you can put the scaffolding on and then you put the um you put the the actual substance on it on the on the scaffold so that's the second thing that I do before I begin the learning session the third and most important one is to attain proper concentration this is crucial because concentration is kind of like um

the speed of your internet connection because I only think is a good analogy because the speed of your internet connection actually defines how fast you're sort of uploading information from you know some server to your computer how fast you're streaming something like a video and so on and I think it's a good way to think about learning so if you're learning at you know 2G and these Edge terrible terrible internet connection speed

um your learning will be very very very slow meaning the amount of information your brain creates or synthesizes and if you're learning it like 3G that's like a bit faster if you're learning at 4G that's kind of okay 5G is even better but having a one gigabyte Broadband you know hyper optic um that's pretty pretty cool that's fast right and that's sort of what you want

to aim for and one gigabyte speed internet connection that would be very profound concentration like very very deep concentration during the learning session and usually what I do in order to attain that is obviously there is one can record like a whole course about concentration but what helps me and what I do currently is that I begin reading a little like earlier right and I also take a walk

before that to sort of um clear my mind or I can meditate or somehow switch from the previous thing that I have been doing and have like this little buffer of time before I begin learning and that actually helps a lot and so the trick that I'm using again in the in case of reading is that if I finished my previous reading session that will say page 20 then I will start my current one not the page 20 but a

page let's say you know 17 or 16 and that gives me I think about five to seven minutes to sort of reread the thing and the purpose of this rereading is not to remember what was said in the book um we're going to take care of that through recalls and and interleaving and other tools but the purpose of that is to sort of just get in the flow because the brain is an interesting machine in a sense that it quickly picks up the

pattern of what you're doing and then it actually takes um it's I think if I'm not mistaken it's a different neural circuit so if you're doing some new activity like you know doing some pattern right with your fingers first it seems like kind of clunky and then it gets better and better better and better and then you're like not thinking about how you're doing that and so on so that in fact is a different neural circuitry

um being used to to perform this repetitive task you may have noticed this with things like running or things like you know doing home cleaning or whatnot like any any sort of task where there is a lot of repetitive elements once you get into it that's the work we kind of use once you get into it it becomes much easier and the reason for that is again a different sort of neural circuit and so I figure that it takes me it may be

different for you but it takes me about five minutes or so to kind of get into full concentration and that is why I begin reading five minutes before the actual thing that I want to understand so very simple you can do the same with the video arm like this video that you're watching right now and again the purpose is not like Bland repetition sort of uploading the same information to your brain but the purpose is to concentrate deeply so we just covered

what you do before the session and again you can pause and recall right now I hope you did that and now I will just summarize um for the sake of keeping the thread which you do before the session is you ensure that the environment is right um that you are properly concentrated by cleaning your mind by sort of ensuring that you are in a good state to concentrate

and then um also picture walking the material and also before that recalling what you had read previously that all of these things kind of like summarized and you know integrated they what they do is that they put you in the right state to understand you know just perceive but understand the information that you're going to be acquiring or recreating there will be a more correct term technically from The

Source material such as this book that I have been demonstrating and so that is what you do before but what you do during the session is primarily concentrating that's all like at this point I don't do anything else apart from just concentrating on the

material that I perceive sometimes I do take notes um I do take notes but the notes that I take they are mostly um I would call them when I I'd say that I take a note when I perceive that there is a big kind of integration happening in my brain and usually that is not about the facts that I read about that you know the

brain has heard a number of neurons and so on like this this kind of thing but that usually is what we call an Insight you know when we when I grasp something that kind of like connects all the puzzle pieces together and then and then I can sort of reflect on that a little bit but I do take notes very rarely right now as I'm reading and I will talk more about that why why

I take few notes a little later because I do write a lot but that's not while I am actually reading and the the primary reason why I stopped taking the notes and just kind of obsessing about you know every thought that I have and so on is just speed so I figured that I I am reading and I'm studying and I'm understanding things much faster if I just perceive

the information and only switch my attention from the sort of flow of reading to let's say writing on my iPhone or on my computer or even on a piece of paper collaborating on the thought that I have only the thought is kind of like important and only that thought is an integration of many many many other things so again as I mentioned previously there

is two versions of this method and I will cover what you do in the second version but this is what I'm doing right now and I just wanted to share that in case you will feel the same way about learning and you will find this productive I highly recommend you try it but yeah that's sort of that sort of where we are try the thing if you find it productive great if you don't there is another version of the matter to resort to I think I should put

a little bit of what your attention to all the sort of nitty-gritty little tricks that people use while reading you know the highlighting the annotations um what else the almost transcribing the book sometimes you know by just obsessively documenting like every fact that they grasped I do think and I will cover that in the second

um in the second variation of the method I do think that can be effective but for a different reason than people think it does not really Aid their understanding or something it just helps to hold their attention on the subject matter I probably should correct myself that it does Aid understanding in some way because when you're writing you're also attending to the matter that you're writing but highlighting for instance specifically highlighting has been proven to be ineffective as a learning

method compared to other our methods or tools you can employ so simply put when you're reading just read don't highlight don't obsess about it and so on and on the document something if that like really really strikes your mind that's a really profound Insight or idea that you sort of want to offload from your work in memory so that it could be imbibing more and more and more information

so that's essentially what I do during the learning session I concentrate on the material and that may be a book that may be a video like this one it'll be like an article or open AI docs or stability AI docs for that matter um any sort of medium in which the information is encoded I concentrate on it I upload the

information to my brain recreate the information in my brain um use this concentration to understand it make sure that I sort of get it that I get what the author is talking about what the thing says and that's very much it I don't obsess over highlights notes and anything on that all right now that I've covered what I did before and during the session

I'm gonna go to the in between sessions part of the method and that I think is crucial because as I pointed out earlier the actual learning the actual change in the nervous system happens in between sessions not during the session well a little bit of it happens during the session but the overwhelming majority of changes occur after the session or

another way to say it in between learning sessions because you wanna many of them right not just one and so what do I do in between sessions first of all I go all in on active recall active recall is probably the most effective learning technique you that is known so far to science and

that you can use that you can rely on and the basic idea of active recall is super simple it's that it's kind of like this evolutionary argument that brain is always the brain is always trying to optimize itself and that is why it basically destroys dissipates the connections that

are no longer being used and strengthens the connections that are being used very actively and that's a very simple idea it's sort of the basis of the modern Neuroscience this um You probably have heard this sentence that the neurons that wire together they fire together and vice versa and yours that fire together they wire together and so on and so that is

um that is what's happening that is why active recall is so important an active recall simply means proactively trying to recall the information or knowledge that you have learned before on the various time scales so this last piece is important because I mentioned that I do active recall before I begin reading the thing but that's one of probably four or five

places in my life or let's say moments throughout my days when I do active recall the second one when I do active recall is in the evening so let's suppose that now is what 11 am or something here in London and I read this book for about 20 or 30 minutes so I kind of like put some information to my head so what I do next in the evening

usually actually when I go to bed so I kind of like lie down in the bed uh and I figured that I best fall asleep when I switch my attention to something when I concentrate on something it may not be the case for you but that's the case for me and I just close my eyes and I try to bring to mind everything that I learned today so this evening it will be you know trying to recall what was it that I read in this how we learn book by stanislav

dehane and it will not come to me easily that's never the case it sort of gets progressively better over time because it's also a skill it's also stored somewhere in the neural circuitry but it never gets like really easy it's kind of like writing in that sense and so I concentrate on the book and I try to proactively without any prompt recall sort of what was the General like

what was what was that I learned from the book and it's interesting that I don't really uh it just occurred to me in fact that I don't really recall like all the facts that the book kind of um provided me with and so what I do is that I recall these chunks sort of broader themes and my understandings of the book and then I go into each one of them and

I'd be like okay what did I learn here or here or here and they try to connect them together because that also AIDS learning so that's what I do in the evening but doing that in the evening is just one of the active three calls of the forms of active recall that I do another one is in the morning I wake up I do my morning routine I get to work and then I journal for a little bit like 10 minutes in the end of

journaling I practice active recall again I concentrate on everything that I learned previously the previous day and I do the same thing as I did in the evening I try to recall the chunks and I try to go into each of the chunks and see sort of what was learned there what did I understand and so on and this is incredibly incredibly helpful and I think this is the moment where I felt For the First Time The Magic of her

active recall and probably you feel too you will feel too because if you do that in the evening in the morning it comes so easily you wouldn't believe me until you tried like if you do with active recall in the evening in the morning is just a joy a pleasure it's so fast it's so smooth like you I'm able to recall everything in just a couple minutes and the third form of active recall that I do is in the end of the week

pretty much the same thing a little bit longer session in the evening is about 2-3 minutes in the morning it's about three five minutes very much same amount and then in the end it gets about 10 minutes so I concentrate on everything that I learned this week and 10 minutes is just because there is more information a lot more information so what these three things what this three active recalls helps me do is

basically bump this ebb and house curve um the famous forgetting curve which basically says that there is a power law you know of for forgetting the information and unless you bring that information back to mind proactively um you will it will be just gone just eliminating so that is sort of my way of integrating active recall and there is two more

things about active recall that I wanted to see the the first one is that it's an abstract concept and you can practice it in all sorts of ways and those three things evening morning weekly is just what I am doing myself what you could do for instance is use active recall in your conversations with friends right you could either join a club or you know just talk to your friends about the things that you're learning and then you will be prompted to do active recall

right on the spot and that's super interesting you can talk to your partner to your colleagues to all sorts of people that in fact is a very very good form of active recall because you know just recalling the information you need to you know make sure that the other person understands it right and that's um that's a bit trickier I would say my version you know purely mental I'm not writing anything just for the sake of speed um my version is kind of like lazier in

a sense because here if I'm recalling for instance what I learned yesterday in retelling that to you well that's uh that's a you know that's a more extensive task we should say and then that's one thing and another important thing that you could do about active recall is writing writing is a perfect form of active recall because you're bringing back the information is a little bit stimulated in contrast to the one that I'm doing because writing

is like writing is always a prompt you know and a completion speaking in GPT threes terms but yeah that's essentially what you could do so bringing it all together let's just quickly go through and summarize the method the first version of the method so that you could have a step-by-step Ferrari as I mentioned in the beginning they could you could just take and apply

step one is to always have a curriculum because that the curriculum that you care about because that reduces the cognitive load on the sport and increases your emotional resonance step two make sure that you ingest information properly that is take care of what you do before and during the session before the session get the environment ready get yourself properly concentrated sort of by taking a little

bit of a step back and reading a few pages a few pages from a few pages back to the moment where you stopped or watching a few minutes before the moment where you stopped and apply certain tools like picture picture walking developed by Barbara Oakley to help your brain construct a framework so that you could you know then add substance to it as you would be reading or another reality would be a map okay and during

the session ensure that you have as deep concentration is humanly possible because that is your Broadband speed to uploading the information to the brain or recreating the information in the brain information that you're learning about from the book and then that's actually very much it what you do during the session you could do things like a super you know insightful note-taking that I'm doing for instance or you could

just concentrate on the material and sort of try to upload it and understand it in the best way you can and then lastly the third and most important piece of the whole learning process what you do in between sessions and that is you go extremely heavy on active recall in many different forms so that you bump up that ebb and house curve a little bit and ensure that you retain the information so that you can then transfer it appropriately when you

need to solve a problem or come up with an idea and you do that by recalling for instance arm before the session by recalling you can do even after the session although that's a bit detrimental because it's mostly recalling from short-term member and long-term memory I I do it in the evening I do it the next morning I do it weekly edit in conversations with friends I do it through writing through journaling like there's a bunch of ways you could do active recall and the last point is to try to

interleave and interconnect what you're learning as much as possible again through the use of journaling conversations with friends writing Etc so there is a bunch of ways to enter leaving and the basic idea is that you always want to be asking okay how does this connect to everything else that I know what does this mean to me so that you activate as many of those neural Pathways as possible and create has been a little hooks to an idea and

retain it successfully that concludes the current version of the method that I'm using have been using for a year and a half that improved How I Learned dramatically now in the next video I will go ahead and explain a little bit I would I wouldn't say dated but a little bit different version of the method that they came up with originally that will be very helpful if you're struggling with certain mental activities like

keeping your attention for a while or you know your your brain is kind of like bumping you with nagging thoughts or if you have ADHD for instance these kinds of things so if you're having trouble with that if you're having trouble with this method try that one instead

SUMMARY

![](https://read.readwise.io/BabyGhost.svg)

The video covers a learning method that involves having a well-defined curriculum, emotional resonance, attention, and repetition. The importance of having a curriculum that excites the learner and the need to create an environment with zero distractions for concentration is emphasized. The method includes recalling previously learned information before a learning session and focusing on understanding the material during the session. The importance of what happens in between learning sessions for long-term learning and retention is also discussed.
