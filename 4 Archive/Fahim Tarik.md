1. Fahim wants to be a co founder
	1. need to understand better why
2. My initial thoughts
	1. I don't want Fahim to be a fully voting co-founder
		1. Still dont trust all his judgements
			1. I think he has good startup acumen, but still have to be careful
		2. Still not sure if he works hard enough
			1. upacking: I think at this stage we need to spend every waking hour thinking about it
			2. not sure if I can get that level commitment from him
	2. counter offer: a COO role with a good equity bump
		1. 1.4 -> 3.5% (10x osama)
		2. Co-founder of Alpine Empower card


2.5 + 2.5 + 3 + 3.5 + 3.5


What I have seen work well:
1. dont want to delay this because we eneded up here because we massively procrastinated on both side and did not set clear expectation on what is next on each other's side 
2. clear expectation and clear division of work
3. I talked to a few other key investors and 

Tarik
Fahim
Osama
Maruf

Adib
Daniel

PJ
Shohag
Rafid
Seemon

### Feedback
1. I need him to work at least part Sunday
2. we all need to work longer hour or need to get things done faster
3. 

### Ed
1. Trying to make Fahim co-founder and trying to figure out what kind of deal is appropriate
2. 



btw re: your equity portion, what seems like the right amount to you? I did talk to a set of investors this week and really want to put the best foot forward to make this work for all of us!

Just to set expectation, while it wont be a full split, I do want to make a good faith offer given I do want this to work and I believe the new direction we have is promising. That said, I would consider a couple of facts:

funding + current investor paradigm: we have ~3M capital in bank and we have a set of investors who would rather not have very divided ownership which might create more drama and break the company.

already created crypto value: we still have decent amount of value in the crypto product we have built, most advisors think that we could potentially get good outcome if we survive till the next bull run

option pool for future folks: In addition, we also need to keep in mind the options pool part of the cap table to make sure we can allocate enough to make future critical hires and also bump up equity in some cases to incentivize critical talents (e.g. Osama). Currently we have ~12% of total shares left as options pool but I would be ok putting some of my shares back, if necessary. 




### Feedback Nov 27
1. Noticed that we have not set deadline about project; how can we manage this better?
2. Notcied 



Questions:
1. How good are we doing in terms of completing experiments within a reasonable time? (e.g. what is the amount of total impact?) How productive do you think the current resource you have are being? How productive / impactful are we being as leaders? How can we setup 2x the experiments and get 2x the work done?
2. How do we manage the team's expectation and manage the comms when things are not going our way? How could we have done better this time? 
3. How do we ensure people don't lose motivation / hope during times like this? What do we need to do as a leader more? How do we show up more?
4. How are we doing in terms of managing timelines and deadlines? 













Ed:
1. Risk 


### Deal
1. a few 100Ks worth of stock and crypto, we are buying, I will make sure to offer you a loan
	1. incentive: helps him buy a house
2. crypto might provide much faster liqudiity
	1. again, faster liq
3. ultimately want to make sure our relationship is more important
	1. I will be very sad but would hire a head of ecosystem + CTO
	2. what I dont want is to grow a resentment, which seems to have formed over the last few months
4. will ensure you are not having to think about money next 2 years +
6. we will likely get some liq in series A and B, I will ensure, you are included in that
7. Why 13% is fine?
	1. If we have even a decent outcome (200M series B), you will have 13-20M assets (accounting for 40-50% dilution)
	2. you are getting your salary (risk free, whereas if you start, for a pretty long period it wont be guaranted)
	3. NOT A ZERO SUM GAME
8. None of the 30 / 40% is going to fly



### Feedback
1. energy during meeting
2. work hour: can we push it up
3. not being present

why are you zoning out?
