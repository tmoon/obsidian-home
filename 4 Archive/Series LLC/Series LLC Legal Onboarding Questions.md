Important because we can only provide end-to-end services in the non-complex cases

- [ ]  Sample task
### Onboarding Qs
1. Name, country of nationality, (if different from nationality--residence), residential address (why--kyc)
2. What is the nature of your service
	1. How much money do you expect to earn per month
	2. How much do you expect to spend per month
	3. other KYC info (throw KYC window after basic service questions)
4. Domicile / nature of services
	1. Do you spend substantial amount of time in the US (as defined by this: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test): may still be ok, but higher risk and move to custom onboarding
		1. Are you a US national / US resident (permanent or otherwise): if yes, we cannot offer this service--maybe recommend them to something else for referral bonus
		2. In the future, we can have "banking only" products for these people to expand
	2. Do you have permanent establishment (or office) in the US: (this maybe ok, so maybe move to custom onboarding)
	6. (checkbox) You understand that this entity is a passthrough entity and you may have to pay taxes in your country of current residence on the income generated through this passthrough entity (more of an explicit ToS)
	7. (checkbox) You understand that even if you close the account, you may have to sign and file business tax form(s) at the end of the year (we are here to help and make this simple--see the compliance plans)
5. Service info: additional thoughts
	1. might explicitly prohibit drop-shipping initially or move them to custom onboarding, as it is more complex to figure out their taxes as most of it will be US sourced income--they should probably just for an US Corporation / instead of an LLC
	2. totally cool: any freelancing services, any service that does any knowledge work FROM OUT OF THE US, any person or business who just want to have a US bank account (but does not generate income from their business otherwise)
6.
