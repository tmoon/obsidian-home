1. di risked: 
	1. have a great deal of funding
	2. we have a team
	3. we have a crypto product that can easily raise at 20M+ valuation (OR launch a token and get close to 40M value)
2. The role that you have here is COO role
	1. I have seen previous example at EDO where he was given ~2% for taking over a professional COO role and later her got close to 5% when he was made CEO
3. What I am comfortable right now is to make you COO (and co founder of alpine empower) and share around 5% equity, if empower becomes successful (we get PMF--as defined by we raise a series with higher than 45M value), we will bump it up to 10%
4. Will have a 5 years vesting schedule
5. I will be making final calls on financing and other sides
6. you will own product and PMF and gtm


8. Don't have time now and will get back on the second week on October and finalize by Oct 15
9. Not just my decision, I started the process of talking to major investors
10. Two man source of value
	1. Token
		1. Token private market (new raise): 25M-35M last offered
		2. Public, now: ~10-15M, later
	2. Equity
		1. contingent on we succeed
