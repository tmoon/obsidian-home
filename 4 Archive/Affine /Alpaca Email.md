Write a short email, with bullet points to Apex Clearing founders, explaining
1. we want to sell tbill or money market funds to US LLCs
2. Ideally these accounts also have basic banking capabilities such as ACH, Wire (both incoming and outgoing)
3. ETF / stock selling are nice to haves

We would like to know the setup and other minimum cost structure and launch timelineDear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the setup, minimum cost structure, and launch timeline for Alpaca.

We are highly interested in implementing Alpaca into our business operations and would like to gather more information regarding its setup requirements. Could you kindly provide us with details on what is needed to set up Alpaca effectively? This could include hardware specifications, software installations, and any additional resources or expertise needed.

Additionally, we would appreciate insights into the minimum cost structure associated with Alpaca. It would be helpful if you could outline the various costs involved in implementing and maintaining the system. This may include licensing fees, subscription plans, or any other necessary expenses.

Furthermore, we would like to have an estimate of the launch timeline for Alpaca. Understanding how long it typically takes from the initiation of setup to full implementation will help us plan accordingly and set realistic expectations within our organization.

We greatly value your expertise and advice in this matter. Your insights will assist us in making an informed decision about incorporating Alpaca into our operations. Thank you for your time and consideration.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
