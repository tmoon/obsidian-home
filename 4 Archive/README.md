# Archive Organization

This folder contains completed and inactive items from your Second Brain.

## Folder Structure

- **Projects/** - Completed or abandoned projects
- **Areas/** - Inactive life areas no longer requiring attention
- **Resources/** - Outdated or archived reference material
- **Day Planner Archive/** - Old daily planners (older than 7 days)
- **Misc/** - Everything else that doesn't fit above categories

## Archival Guidelines

### When to Archive

**Projects:**
- Completed successfully → Celebrate, then archive with completion date
- No activity for 30+ days → Reassess, then archive
- Abandoned/cancelled → Document why, then archive

**Areas:**
- No files or minimal content (< 3 notes)
- No activity for 60+ days
- No longer a sphere of responsibility

**Day Planners:**
- Older than 7 days (process during weekly review)

**Resources:**
- Outdated information
- No longer relevant to current work

### Naming Convention for Archived Items

Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD - Item Name`

Examples:
- `2026-01-03 - Website Redesign Project`
- `2025-12-15 - Wedding Planning`

This makes it easy to find items by date and understand when they were archived.

## Notes

- Don't reorganize existing archived content unless needed
- This structure applies to NEW archived items going forward
- Archive aggressively during weekly reviews
- Archive is not deletion - you can always restore items if needed
