# Your Second Brain - Operating Manual

> **Your Personal Chief of Staff for World-Class CEO Performance**
> This system helps you ruthlessly prioritize, execute with clarity, and become a world-leading founder.

## System Philosophy

You're building a venture-backed company (Multiplyr → SignalPilot pivot) while managing multiple life domains. Your Second Brain is your competitive advantage - it frees your mind to think strategically while ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

### What is SignalPilot
SignalPilot is a context-aware AI copilot for data exploration. It aggregates context from across your data stack—schemas, dbt models, query logs, business metadata—via MCP, then generates and executes Python analysis directly in your notebook. It doesn't just answer "why did X change"; it thinks like your best analyst: gathering relevant context, forming hypotheses, writing code, and iterating toward insight.

**Core Principles:**
- **Radical Candor**: Challenge yourself directly on priorities
- **GTD Foundation**: Capture everything, process ruthlessly, execute with trust
- **Deep Work**: Protect focus time for high-leverage tasks
- **PARA Method**: Organize by actionability, not category

## Your Current System

### PARA Structure

**Projects** → Finite goals with deliverables
- **0 Running Projects**: This week's focus (1-3 max)
- **1 Next Projects**: Queued for next 1-2 weeks
- **Someday Tasks**: Parking lot for later (review monthly)
- Each project has: Goals, Deliverables (intermediate packets), Tasks
- Review weekly, archive if inactive 14+ days

**Areas** → Ongoing responsibilities (8 focused domains)
- Health & Wealth · Productivity · Reading · Cooking · Organization · Taxes · Travel · Real Estate
- Pick 3 to focus on each week, ignore the rest
- Only maintain areas requiring monthly attention

**Resources** → Reference material organized by theme
- 3 MOCs: Productivity Systems · Health Optimization · AI Tools & Prompts
- Readwise imports (books, articles, podcasts)
- Access by topic, not source

**Archive** → Completed/inactive items
- Projects older than 30 days with no activity
- Day Planners older than 7 days
- Empty/inactive areas

---

## Daily Workflow

**Morning (7:00 - 9:30)**
1. Open today's Day Planner
2. Review Google Calendar (auto-populated)
3. Pick ONE "eat the frog" task (hardest/most important)
4. Execute 7:30 AM in peak cognitive state

**Throughout Day**
- Capture EVERYTHING in Braindump Inbox (single capture point)
- Apply 2-minute rule: If <2min, do now
- Time block deep work (25min Pomodoros)
- Take breaks (movement, hydration)

**Evening (21:00)**
- Reflection: What shipped? What moved forward?
- Preview tomorrow's calendar
- Pick tomorrow's "eat the frog" task
- Journal/wind down

---

## Weekly Review (30min Every Sunday)

**Non-negotiable maintenance ritual - this is what keeps the system working.**

**Minutes 0-10: Process Inbox**
- Empty Braindump Inbox to zero
- Apply 2-minute rule or delegate to Projects/Areas/Someday

**Minutes 10-20: Review Projects**
- Check each active project
- Archive stale projects (no activity 14+ days)
- Pick 1-3 FOCUS projects for next week

**Minutes 20-25: Plan Week**
- Review Google Calendar
- Schedule 5-7 high-leverage tasks from focus projects
- Block deep work time

**Minutes 25-30: Focus Areas**
- Pick 3 Areas needing attention
- Ignore the other 5

Use: Weekly Review Template in Templates folder

## The One Thing That Matters

**Do the weekly review. Everything else flows from this.**

Without the weekly review:
- Inbox clogs → decision fatigue
- Projects stagnate → unclear priorities
- System becomes burden → guilt and avoidance

With the weekly review:
- Inbox at zero → mental clarity
- 1-3 focus projects → ruthless prioritization
- System becomes weapon → execution with confidence

**Schedule it now:** Sunday 9 PM, 30 minutes, recurring, non-negotiable.

---

## Decision Framework

**For every task/idea, ask:**

1. **<2 minutes?** → Do it now
2. **Aligned with company goals?** → Projects folder
3. **Ongoing responsibility?** → Areas folder (pick appropriate area)
4. **Reference material?** → Resources folder (or relevant MOC)
5. **Might do someday?** → Someday Tasks
6. **Not actionable?** → Archive or delete

**When in doubt, delete.** You can always recreate if truly important.

## CEO Performance Principles

**From world-class founders:**

**Energy > Time**
- You don't manage time, you manage energy
- Peak cognitive work (7:30-9:30 AM) for strategic thinking
- Protect deep work blocks like investor meetings

**Ruthless Prioritization**
- Say no to everything that doesn't serve your vision
- 1-3 focus projects per week MAX
- If everything is important, nothing is important

**Systems > Discipline**
- Weekly review eliminates decision fatigue
- Templates ensure consistency without thinking
- Automation (Dataview) works while you sleep

**Deliverables > Tasks**
- Projects should produce shareable assets
- Tasks are means, deliverables are ends
- Ask: "What can I ship this week?"

**Review > Planning**
- Reflecting on what worked > planning what might work
- Weekly review is your strategic advantage
- Most CEOs plan too much, review too little

## Emergency Protocols

**System feels overwhelming?**
1. Do ONE weekly review
2. Archive everything inactive
3. Pick ONE project to focus on this week
4. Ignore everything else

**Inbox too full?**
1. Block 1 hour
2. Apply 2-minute rule aggressively
3. Move everything else to Someday Tasks
4. Start fresh

**Lost clarity on priorities?**
1. Review your company vision
2. What moves the needle THIS week?
3. Archive projects not aligned
4. Focus on 1-3 max
