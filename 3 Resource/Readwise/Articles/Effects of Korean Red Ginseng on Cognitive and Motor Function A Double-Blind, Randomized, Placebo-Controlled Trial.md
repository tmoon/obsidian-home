## Highlights
- Jin *et al*. [[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659585/#B006) studied the effects of red ginseng extract on learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5ab630e7njq1jx765vvrvq3))
    - ==Note: **They also found that the ratio was important--hence probably should buy from a good brand**==
- Our results support only one of our hypotheses, which is that Korean red ginseng decreases P300 latency related to cognitive function, but not our other hypothesis that it would improve Vienna test scores of fine motor performance. Several possible explanations can be proposed for this unexpected finding. One explanation is that improvement in fine motor performance may not be associated with decreased P300 latency. Another possible explanation is that for the distinctive efficacy of fine motor movement, a longer trial of red ginseng is needed to observe improvements.

    - ==Note: **Only helps with latency?**==
