## Highlights
- Ginseng has also been reported to improve ADHD symptoms [

  27]. In addition, ginsenosides are reported to elevate levels of dopamine and norepinephrine; hence, they could potentially be used to treat ADHD. Ginseng’s therapeutic benefits in ADHD were confirmed in an observational study involving ADHD participants (18 kids, ages 6–14) given Korean red ginseng (KRG, *Panax ginseng*) twice per day for 8 weeks (1,000 mg twice daily). In this study, KRG improved attention as measured by significant differences in omission errors measured by the computerized ADHD-diagnostic system (ADS) ( at baseline, at 8 weeks, ) [

- Studies also indicate that *G. biloba* may have therapeutic benefits in ADHD. For instance, Uebel-von Sandersleben et al. [

  24] reported improvement in overall quality of life, ADHD core symptoms, and Continuous Performance Test (CPT) performance in children given *G. biloba* (240 mg/daily) for 3–5 weeks. A reduced dose of *G. biloba* (50 mg), when combined with ginseng (200 mg) for 4 weeks of treatment, significantly improved ADHD symptoms in a test group of 36 children (ages 3–17) as quantified by Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised (long version) (CPRS-R [L]) [

- The effects of vitamin C treatment with alpha linolenic acid- (ALA-) rich nutritional supplementation in the form of flax oil on blood fatty acids composition and behavior in children with ADHD were also examined [

  72]. This study found that red blood cell membrane fatty acids were significantly improved in ADHD patients receiving the above supplementation and alleviated ADHD symptoms in ADHD patients as evidenced by reduction of hyperactivity scores [

  72]. As mentioned above, oxidative stress has been postulated to play a role in ADHD [

  73]. Thus, the antioxidant effect of vitamin C may have contributed to the beneficial effect of this supplementation regimen in ADHD children, along with effects of ALA (ALA is a precursor fatty acid and with elongation and unsaturation gets converted to docosahexaenoic acid which is critical for normal brain development) [
