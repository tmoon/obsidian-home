## Highlights
- Another important point about ADHDis that it has nothing to do with intelligence,whether or not we're talking about intelligencemeasured by a standard IQ testa rather controversial issue as many of you probably know,there are lots of forms of intelligencethat a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick upemotional intelligence, musical intelligence,spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences.None of them are related to ADHD.Being very high functioning doesn't make youmore likely to have ADHD and being ADHD
  doesn't necessarily mean that you have a low IQ.So there are people with ADHD who have low IQspeople with ADHD with high IQ,people with ADHD with high emotional IQ or with low IQin the emotional scale, it's all over the place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sd4f39mq6251t8yea18517))
    - ==Note: **Anyone in the IQ curve can have ADHD**==
- They really can't focus,even if they really want to, but that's simply not the case.People with ADHD yes, they are distractable.Yes, they are impulsive.Yes, they are easily annoyedby things happening in the room.They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well.Not always, but oftenhowever people with ADHD can have a hyper focusand incredible ability to focuson things that they really enjoyor and are intrigued by. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sggqqr95zh9pdq7pw6bvwe))
- There are a couple other thingsthat people with ADHD display quite often.One is challenges with time perception.Now time perception is a fascinating aspectof how our brain worksand later we're going to talk about time perceptionand how you can actually get better at time perception.It's very likely that right now you are doing thingsthat get in the way of optimal time perception ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sgha384pnftqd0w12mnx6w))
	- ==Note: Time perception is a big challenge when you have ADHD==
- from a neuro-biological perspective,
  they have a very clear identity and signatureand that's dopamine.Dopamine is released from neurons,it's what we call a neuromodulatorand as a neuromodulator it changes the activityof the circuits in the brain,such that certain circuits are more active than othersand in particular,dopamine creates a heightened state of focus.It tends to contract our visual worldand it tends to make us pay attention to things
  that are outside and beyond the confines of our skin.That's what we call exteroception.Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivationand wanting things outside the confines of our skin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sgv0dznbvhdcz4bkm1mtx9))
- there are two main types of circuits thatwe need to think about with respect to ADHD,attention and dopamine.The first one is called the default mode network.The default mode network is the network of brain areasin your brain and my brain and in everybody's brainthat is active when we're not doing anything
  when we're just sitting there idle at rest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sgzq17d9ca4h6qq6zpv5ra))
    - ==Note: **Two types of neural circuits: 1) default 2) task network (goal oriented)**==
- Now normally in a person without ADHD,the task networks and the default mode networksare going in kind of Seesaw fashion,they are actually what we call anti-correlated.So it's not just that they are not correlated,they're actually opposing one anotherthey are anti-correlated.In a person with ADHD,the default mode networks and the tasks networksare actually more coordinated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4shkfy8zkrkhf4z268g90f7))
- at you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs,or they tend to indulge in non drug stimulants.So things like drinking, six cups of coffeeor quadruple espressos,or when it was more prominent
  smoking a half a pack of cigarettesand drinking four cups of coffee a dayor if the person had access to itusing cocaine as a recreational drugor amphetamine as a recreational drug.All of those substances that I just describedin particular cocaine and amphetamine,but also coffee and cigarettesincrease levels of multiple neurotransmitters,but all have the quality of increasing levelsof dopamine in the brain and in particular,in the regions of the brain that regulate attention
  and these task related and default mode networks okay ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4shtavn9sqvpp8egj65gvqq))
- the fact that having enough dopamine is requiredin order to coordinate these neural circuitsthat allow for focus and quality decision-makingan equally valid idea is that these childrenand these adults are actually trying to self-medicateby pursuing these compounds, right?Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4shx1eysynv89a3r6sgbk9w))
    - ==Note: **Does amitripltiline increase dopamine?**==
- takes that drug,it turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus, their ability to focus on things other than things they absolutely care intensely about goes up, likewise, children who consume anything that increases their levels of dopamine,if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer,they tend to be able to focus more.Now, this is very different than childrenwho do not have ADHD.When they consume too much sugar, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sj6b49ekbvv6gskan0anpn))
- o dopamine and low levels of dopamine
  apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD,that dopamine hypothesisis what led to the idea that treating people,children and adults included with dopaminergic compoundswould somehow increase their ability to focusand if you look at the major drugs that were developedand now marketed by pharmaceutical companiesfor the treatment of ADHD,those drugs have names like Ritalin.Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
  and some of the other derivatives,they all serve to increase levels of dopaminein particular dopamine in the networksthat control task directed behavior,and that coordinate the default mode networkand these task-related networks.So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin.Ritalin is a prescription stimulant that isprescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sj8j89t46pqzztwne1q4v0))
- owever, I'm aware that up to 25% of college students,and perhaps as many as 35% of all individualsbetween the ages of 17 and 30 are taking Adderallon a regular or semi-regular basisin order to work, in order to study
  and in order to function and focus in their daily life.Even though they have not been diagnosed with ADHD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sjgbpdppfq8f3f61x9tgrg))
  
- n fact, when I was in college,I had this little trick that may or may not workfor some of you,which is if I couldn't focus on the materialI was trying to learn,I would delude myself into thinkingthat it was the most interesting thing in the world.I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself,okay, this, I won't mention the subjects,I absolutely love this.I would just, I would tell myself that I loved itand I noticed that just that selectiveor deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit,
  whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine,allowed me to focus and remember the informationand somewhat surprisingly or perhaps not surprisingly,I would often fall in love with the information.I find that that was my favorite class.So it was what I wanted to learn the most.So that's one way you can do it artificially,but kids with ADHD, they can't do that, right?They're told to sit stilland they end up getting up 11 times. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sjkmt98mh4x52jm044hy5w))
- And their answer was, on the face of it, it seems crazy,but provided that the lowest possible dose is usedand that that dosage is modulating as they grow olderand develop those powers of attention,their observation was that they've seen more kids benefitthan not benefit from that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sjp5cwm04ef84nn8a4rntg))
- said, well, why would you do it nowas opposed to during puberty or after puberty?And their answer was very specific
  and I think very important, what they said was look,neuroplasticity is greatest in childhoodand tapers off after about age 25,but neuroplasticity from age three until age 12 or 13is exceedingly high and they're right,when you sit backand you look at the literature on neuroplasticity,you'd say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticityis much greater than adult plasticity,but that early childhood plasticity is far and away
  the period in which you can reshape the brainat an accelerated rate.So this lines up really well with the clinical literature.Not surprisingly,there are clinician that early treatment is key.If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physicianand treat these things early,these drugs can allow these frontal circuits,these task-related circuits to achieve their appropriatelevels of functioning and for kids to learn how to focusin a variety of different contexts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sjrw6q87xy4mgad7aazc52))
- So everything from mental focusto the ability to control their bodies improvedwhen they were in the elimination diet group,what was eliminated?Well, the elimination diet in this particular studywas a so-called oligoantigenic diet.It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determinewhich foods they had antibodies for,meaning that they were mildly allergic to.Now in this study, it was very importantthat the kids not be extremely allergic to any food
  because as I mentioned before,they actually served as a control at one point in the studywhere they were eating all sorts of foods,including foods that had mild allergies to.So basically what the study said was that eliminating foodsto which children have allergiescan dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sjygq32r2axfrz3k7qw5y9))
    - ==Note: **Eliminating inflammatory food had a dramatic effect on ADHD symptoms**==
- However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatriststhat I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this,
  every single one said children with ADHD,as much as possible,should be encouraged to avoid high sugarand simple sugar foods of most kindsand if they can find particular foodsthat exacerbate their symptoms,obviously eliminating those foods is beneficialand the foods that exacerbate their symptomschange over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4skb7p4tzpcb1ce3x0bc0c0))
- What this tells me is that children,especially young children who have ADHDshould probably not eat much sugarin particular simple sugars.In addition to that,exploring whether or not they have existing allergiesto foods, they already consume might be a good idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4skc38tfqh1yt4d8fa5h3bg))
    - ==Note: **Avoid simple sugar and/or food with allergenic possibilities**==
- It does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids in adults
  that include EPA is of 1000 milligrams or morecan allow adults with ADHDor mild attention deficit issuesto function well on lower doses of medicationand in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely.So what this says is once again,that the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial,will they cure or eliminate ADHD?I think it's safe to say, no,they are playing a supportiveor what we call a modulatory role. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4skgc6ykxgryb3j7hqkhhh8))
    - ==Note: **1000mg omega-3 fatty acid helps--might help modulating antidepressant**==
- If you see something that you're looking for,or you're very interested in something,you are definitely missing other informationin part because you're over focusing on somethingand this leads to a very interesting hypothesisabout what might go wrong in ADHD,where we've always thought that they cannot focusand yet we know they can focus on thingsthey care very much about,
  well, maybe just maybethey are experiencing more attentional blinksthan people who do not have ADHDand indeed, there are data now to support the possibilitythat that's actually what's happeningand that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD.It should also be exciting to anyone that cares aboutincreasing their focus and their ability to attend.What this is saying is that these circuits,that underlie focus in our ability to attendand our ability to eliminate distraction,
  they aren't just failing to focus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4smg3vdztt411ms26p5mk0x))
    - ==Note: **Attentional blink is a common trait for ADHD**==
- There are now published accounts in the literatureof a simple practice done for about 15 minutes,where subjects were asked to just sit quietly eyes closed
  and do what is sort of akin to meditation,but to not direct their mindinto any particular state or place,but simply to think about their breathingand to focus on their so-called interoception,focus on how their body feels,their mind drifted to bring it back, okay?So it's basically meditation for about 15 minutes.That might not seem like a significant or unusual practiceor that it would have any impact at all.But remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes,
  significantly reduced the number of attentional blinksthat people would carry out.In other words, their focus got betterin a near permanent way without any additional training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4smmq1zp19s1p010jc7xfyk))
    - ==Note: **#meditation practices (even a single 17 min session) have PROVEN to alter the state of mind (near) permanently**==
- ow what's interestingand will immediately make sense to you as to why
  this is important is that the rate of blinkingis controlled by dopamine.So what this means is that dopamineis controlling attention.Blinks relate to attention and focus,and therefore the dopamine and blinking system is one waythat you constantly modulate and updateyour perception of timeand fortunately, it's also one that you can control.So the basic takeaway of this study was that blinkingcontrols time perception,
  but also that levels of dopaminecan alter your sense of time and stay with me here,and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked.They are working together to control your attention.When dopamine levels go up,people tend to overestimate how long something lasted, why?Because they are processing time more finelyit's slow motion mode.When dopamine levels are lower,
  they tend to underestimate time intervals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4smy7rj83x1hq0nbdbzhv9m))
    - ==Note: **Dopamine and blinking rates are both mutually correlated with attention, which also is correlated w the perception of time**==
- what's going on in people with ADHD,they are not good at managing their time,they tend to run late, or they are disorganized.They are not just disorganized in space,meaning in that physical space, around them,they're disorganized in time.Their dopamine is low, we know that as welland so they are underestimating time intervalsand so it makes perfect sense that they would be late.
  It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of timeor the ability to focus.This is really exciting because what it means is thatchildren with ADHD, adults, with ADHDor people with normal levels of focusthat want to improve their ability to focuscan do so through a training that involveslearning how often to blink and when,and how to keep their visual focus on a given targetand it turns out this study has actually been done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sn238287ajv1sw8y1g303q))
    - ==Note: **ADHD folks are not good w time because of their lack of dopamine and there are ways to enhance focus with learning how often to blink**==
- So what they did in this study is they had these kidsfocus their visual attentionon some object that was relatively close,like their hand for a minute or so,which actually takes some effort if you try and do that,they were allowed to blink.However, it's known from other workthat if people can consciously override the desire to blink,at least to the point where they feel like they have to,or else their eyes were dry out,that actually can increase attention even furtherand they had conditions where they would look at a point
  further across the room and even further across the room.It only took a few minutes each day to do this30 seconds in one condition, or maybe a minuteand then at another stationof looking a little bit further outand a little bit further out, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sn6fcf42fcshynrc6ftefg))
    - ==Note: **Reducing blinking has powerful impact on focus**==
- o what you will find is that some kids with ADHDare now given a rubber band on their desk,literally a rubber band that's attached to their deskand they're able to pull on it,even snap it against the desk,if I had done that when I was a kid,I think my teachers were throw me out of class,but I think it's great that they're allowing themto do this now as a way of movingsome of their physical energy out
  or engage their physical energy, rather,as opposed to trying to sitstatue still all the time and attendand it turns out that does enhance these children's abilityto focus mentally when they have some physical activityto attend to and it turns out it also can work for adults. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sn9h4e2n73h7dat6n1w9x7))
    - ==Note: **Fidgeting tools have proven to increase the ability to focus for kids as their nervous system for sitting still is not well built, they are often more restless**==
- So if you look at the number of yearsthat people have been using cannabis on a regular basis,either daily or up to excuse me, weekly, or up to daily,what you find is that for people
  that have not been using cannabis at all,or have only been using it for about two years,their rates of eye blinks are much higherthan people who've been using it chronically for 10 years.In other words, peoplewho may be using cannabis for 10 years,don't blink very often at all.Now cannabis has well known effects in depleting memory,but it does seem to engage the focusand blinking system in a way that increases focus.So basically what I'm saying ismarijuana seems to increase people's focus,but then they can't remember what they were focusing on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4snh4hsqpm9997wtqgqmq52))
    - ==Note: **Cannabis can have good effect on focus, but it has memory depleting effect which is undesired**==
- if you are caffeine adapted, in other words,if you are used to drinking caffeinethen the ingestion of caffeine,most often will cause vasodilation who actually allow moreblood flow through.However, if you are not caffeine adapted,it will cause vasoconstrictiondue to an increased stress response.
  So if you're familiar with caffeine,caffeine can actually have a little bit moreof a relaxation responsealthough if you drink enough of it,it will make you amped up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sntxes0f4mzjajfk4ja5gz))
    - ==Note: **Caffeine can be a very useful smart-drug if you are used to it**==
- More likely the best use of things like Adderall, Modafinil,armodafinil and Ritalin is going to beto combine those treatments with behavioral exercisesthat actively engage the very circuitsthat you're trying to train up and enhanceand then perhaps I want to highlight perhapstapering off those drugsso that then one can use those circuits
  without any need for chemical intervention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4snx8k6ap38esfe0y6z1xfk))
    - ==Note: **The best way to fix ADHD issues is to use a combination of drugs and behavioral exercises e.g. #meditation**==
- consumption of omega-3 fatty acidscan positively modulatethe systems for attention and focus.So then the question becomes how much EPA,how much DHA does that differ for,what's helpful for depression, et ceteraand actually it does differin reviewing the studies for thisit appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA
  turns out to be an important inflection point.So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3swill have DHA and EPAand typically it's the EPAthat's harder to get at sufficient levels,meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oilin order to get above that 1000 milligramor 2000 milligram threshold to improve moodand other functions.But for sake of attention,there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail
  and while the EPA component is important,the most convincing studies point to the fact that gettingabove 300 milligrams per day of DHA is really where youstart to see the attentional effects.Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPAfor sake of mood and other biological functions,almost without question,you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sp0ge8mddd3h2qek0vq68n))
    - ==Note: **We need at least 300mg of DHA per day for optimal attention level**==
- phosphatidylserine that has been explored for its capacityto improve the symptoms of ADHD.Again, I don't think this is any direct way,but rather in a modulatory way,but it appears that phosphatidylserinetaken for two months for 200 milligrams per day,was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children.It has not been looked at in adults yet as,at least as far as I know,but that this effect was greatly enhanced
  by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.So now we're starting to see synergistic effectsof omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidylserineagain that was 200 milligrams per day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sp4gjav7es7p252j191yr1))
    - ==Note: **phosphodiaterine w/ omega-3 fatty acid helps w ADHD in children**==
- ne such compound is so-called alpha GPC,which is a form of choline and increases acetycholinetransmission dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day,which has a very high dosage spread out,typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread outthroughout the day have been shown to offsetsome of the effects of age-related cognitive decline,improved cognitive functioningpeople that don't have age-related cognitive declinethat's a very high dose.
  Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to studyor to enhance learning of any kind,they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligramsthat's more typical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4spgc3ge26w8pdk8p7j72hy))
    - ==Note: **alpha GPC can be helpful for lowering the effect of age-related cognittive decline**==
- tams in the treatment of patientswith mild cognitive disorders
  and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin.That's a mouthful.What this study basically points tois the fact that people who are experiencing some degreeof inability to focus due to prior concussionor some vascular event, a stroke or a schemey of any kind,because neurons need blood,when the blood supply is cut off to neurons,or when there's a bleed in the brain.Subsequent to that, oftenthere are challenges in maintaining focus.This is very common for people who have done sports,where there's a lot of running into each other
  with your head like rugby football, hockey, and so forth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4spn585at71hp30pbfg7z0q))
    - ==Note: **For post-concussion this can help**==
- If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHDcompounds or improve focus and related themes,and you like reading about this stuff,there's an excellent review articlethat I can refer you to it'sby Ahn et al, AHN it was published in 2016so it's a little bit behind the times,although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that,which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed,
  Racetams., and Adderall and Ritalin,and various forms of dopaminergic agentsand cholinergic agents spells out whether or notthey are sold over the counter by prescription,and really lines them up in all their effects,their drawbacks, et cetera.I'll refer you to that study.It's available in its full length form online for freeit's Hen et al the journal is neuro plasticity,neural plasticity, 2016 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4spr75zeyf3tmf7xkh3e69h))
    - ==Note: **[[ADHD treatment with natural elements, Ahn et al 2016]]: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2016/1320423/**==
- And as a final final point,I also want to mention something about technologiesthat are making it harder for all of us to focus,regardless of whether or notwe have pre-existing ADHD or not.You can probably guess where this is going.Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone.
  I'm sure there are a few individuals out therethat don't have a smartphone.Nonetheless, most people have them.Most kids want one, as soon as they can get themand they are small, they grab our attention entirely.But within that small box of attention,there are millions of attentional windowsscrolling by, right?So just because it's one device that we look atdoes not mean that we are focused,we are focused on our phone,but because of the way,in which context switches up so fast within the phone,
  it's thought that the brain is struggling nowto leave that rapid turnover of context, right?Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages,many, many Twitter feeds many, many websites.Basically the whole world,at least in virtual format is availablewithin that small box.Unlike any other technologyhumans have ever dealt with before,even though there are trillionsinfinite number of bits of informationin the actual physical world,your attentional window,
  that aperture of constrictionand dilating that visual windowis the way in which you cope with all thatoverwhelming information typically.Well within the phone,your visual aperture is set to a given widthit's about this big,typically the phone seem to be getting bigger,but nonetheless, it's about that bigand within there,your attentional window is grabbing it near infinitenumber of bits of information, colors, movies.If a picture is worth 1000 words,a movie is worth a billion pictures,
  the brain loves visual motionand so the question is,does that sort of interaction on a regular basislead to deficits in the types of attentionthat we need in order to perform wellin work, in school, relationships, et ceteraand the short answer is yes, it does appear sowe are inducing a sort of ADHDand while the studies on this are ongoing because prominentuse of smartphones really took off right around 2010 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sq6m5smvm7s6ftyj5673q2))
    - ==Note: **Technology is inducing ADHD**==
- you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayedto hear that in order to avoid this decreasein attentional capacity,adolescents needed to use their smartphonefor less than 60 minutes per day,in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks.Otherwise they started to really runinto significant issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sqbrdh25tcys1wv3xk2x0e))
    - ==Note: **Even just more than 60mins of cellphone time causes problems in attention and focus**==
