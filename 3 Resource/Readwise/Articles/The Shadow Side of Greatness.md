Every strength has a trade-off, and success often comes with costs. People should ask themselves what kind of pain they are willing to bear in the name of achieving their dreams.

- Mark Manson writes in his popular book, [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://jamesclear.com/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f*ck), the most important question to ask yourself is not, “What kind of success do I want?”, but rather, “What kind of pain do I want?
