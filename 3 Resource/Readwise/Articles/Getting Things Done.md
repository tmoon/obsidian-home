## Highlights
- The crux of the GTD system is to **store every task, reminder, and note bouncing around your brain in an external organization system to free up your mental energy to actually focus on the task at hand**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kk6wq3793c9td9pqpm4xdb))
- You’ll be aware and in control of your entire workload so you can be fully present in each moment without the nagging feeling that you should be doing something else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kk7e9ckpjq0cwh9zm6vnaj))
- The five steps of the GTD system are:
  1. **Capture** all the problems and ideas that are taking your attention.
  2. **Clarify** what each one means and what you need to do about it.
  3. **Organize** the decisions and actions you’ve clarified.
  4. **Reflect** on everything in front of you to choose what to tackle next.
  5. **Engage** with the task (get it done). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kmtqxbmvy2tph7758pvbq8))

- **Capture *everything—*big and small, short-term and long-term, anything in your life that you feel should be different and that you have some motivation or commitment to change** (anything from career strategy ideas to a reminder to fix that gadget in your junk drawer).

- Don’t stop to work on anything else—just **focus on capturing absolutely everything as quickly as possible.** When you’re done, you’ll take time to assess every item. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kmvvw61f4cx68h8jswy6gc))
- The next step is to **decide the intended outcome for each item and figure out what the immediate next action is to make progress toward that outcome.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kmwhjwfqhhq7098axrs3rc))
- Based on the next action you determine for each item, you’ll either:
  1. **Throw it away.** If it doesn’t require any action and you won’t need the information later, toss it.
  2. **Keep it for your reference files.** These items don’t require any action, but they have information that may be useful later.
  3. **Do it.** If the next action takes less than two minutes, do it now.
  4. **Label it a project.** The GTD system defines projects as anything that requires more than one step and can be finished within a year—anything from planting your garden to learning new software at work. Put a sticky note on it labeling it a project and put it in a Pending pile.
  5. **Decide to delegate it.** If the next action will take longer than two minutes, consider whether you’re the best person for the job. If not, put a sticky note on it marking that you’re delegating it and to whom, and put it in the Pending pile.
  6. **Save it for later.** Label items that don’t require any action now but you might want to follow up on in the future as “Someday/Maybe.” If you want to create a reminder to reconsider it on a specific date, make a note of that date so you can put it in your tickler file or on your calendar in the next step. Put all these items in the Pending pile.
  7. **Defer to next actions.** If it’ll take longer than two minutes and you can’t delegate it, label it “Next Action” and put it in the Pending pile.
  Here’s a flowchart that shows Steps 1 to 3 more clearly:

- Step 3: Organize
  In the clarifying step, you made a decision about the next step for each item; now you’re going to organize the items into files, lists, and calendar items. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kn2v885bk1nk5yeerhks6z))
- Step 4: Reflect
  **Regularly reflect on all your lists and files to help you make smarter choices about which tasks to tackle.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kn3p6mfv7r5dgp8kh6kped))
- Review your calendar daily and your Next Actions list frequently, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kn3vpdda3vbg3z4xyznv69))
- a Weekly Review is critical for keeping your lists and files clean and current. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kn459mpnvzs5qhha716q39))
- In order to prioritize the options in front of you, you need to have a context for how they fit into the bigger picture of your life and priorities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kn6e3a7n00zx8wehxnjgq6))
- Natural Planning Method, and it consists of these steps:
  1. **Define your purpose and principles.** Your purpose is the intention of the project, and your principles create the boundaries. If you’re planning a birthday dinner, your purpose is to celebrate and the boundaries could be factors like how affordable you want the restaurant to be.
  2. **Envision your outcome.** Your purpose is your *why*, while your outcome is the *what*: What will a successful outcome look, feel, and sound like? You might imagine your dinner happening around a big outdoor table, with all your friends laughing and sharing food. When you picture something and focus on it, it helps you create it and makes you more excited to achieve it.
  3. **Brainstorm.** This is the *how*. Your brain naturally wants to fill in the gaps to determine how to make your vision a reality. During this stage, you might question whether the restaurant is open today, what time you need to go, and whether there’s gas in the car. Use mind maps or other brainstorming techniques to jot down as many ideas as you can without judging or criticizing the ideas along the way.
  4. **Organize.** This is the step when you organize all the random thoughts, questions, and ideas from the brainstorming process. You’ll naturally organize them based on logistics, priorities, and what needs to happen first: Call the restaurant to see if it’s open and make a reservation, then invite the guests, then get yourself dressed and ready to go.
  5. **Determine your next actions.** Determine what can actually be done now, and who’s going to do it. For dinner, your next action is to call the restaurant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kna4jr1kj8tph138y8ny23))

- The Four-Criteria Model: Narrow Your Options
  This model helps you narrow down your choices based on four criteria: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5jyc0cm4bn8x0c0kmqcyxzw))
    - ==Note: **4 criteria: context (grouping by location / task area), time available (long or short), energy available (harder tasks earlier in the day), priority (higher priority tasks first)**==
