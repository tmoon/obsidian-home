## Highlights
- Each burner symbolizes one major quadrant of your life.
  1. The first burner represents your family.
  2. The second burner is your friends.
  3. The third burner is your health.
  4. The fourth burner is your work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sccef1jnte7105cbnfma8s))
- **The Four Burners Theory** says that “in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be *really* successful you have to cut off two.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4scchzb2g0mvghd6d3w031h))
    - ==Note: **Is this true? Can you have it all?**==
- Option 1: Outsource Burners
  We outsource small aspects of our lives all the time. We buy fast food so we don't have to cook. We go to the dry cleaners to save time on laundry. We visit the car repair shop so we don't have to fix our own automobile. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4schxvx8hfcz3cat023mg3n))
- n theory, entrepreneurs and business owners can outsource the work burner. They do it by hiring employees. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4scjfv1qf0y1p358136cjtz))
- Outsourcing keeps the burner running, but is it running in a meaningful way? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4sckr7xznhwg4kc30d9aare))
    - ==Note: **This is especially important for important tasks--the [[Eisenhower Matrix]] is probably a good framework--if it is important and/or urgent, do it yourself, otherwise delegate**==
- Option 2: Embrace Constraints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4scnpfy6pzkp22862hrcbk8))
- Option 3: The Seasons of Life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4scpd4c8sxqfwq49hcyf94s))
- You don't have to give up on your dreams forever, but life rarely allows you to keep all four burners going at once. Maybe you need to let go of something for this season. You can do it all in a lifetime, but not at the same damn time. [In the words of Nathan Barry](https://nathanbarry.com/seasons/), “Commit to your goal with everything you have—for a season.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4scqdzsyjnnn83spsw1aqrh))
