## Highlights
- The art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of our great men. —Capt. J. A. Hatfield ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=306))
    - ==Note: **Great #quote**==
- Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action. —David Kekich ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=333))
- Part 1 describes the whole game, providing a brief overview of the system and an explanation of why it’s unique and timely, and then presenting the basic methodologies themselves in their most condensed and basic form. Part 2 shows you how to implement the system. It’s your personal coaching, step by step, on the nitty-gritty application of the models. Part 3 goes even deeper, describing the subtler and more profound results you can expect when you incorporate the methodologies and models into your work and your life. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=367))
- We can never really be prepared for that which is wholly new. We have to adjust ourselves, and every radical adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem; we undergo a test, we have to prove ourselves. It needs subordinate self-confidence to face drastic change without inner trembling. —Eric Hoffer ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=468))
- Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=566))
- most stress they experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept. Even those who are not consciously “stressed out” will invariably experience greater relaxation, better focus, and increased productive energy when they learn more effectively to control the “open loops” of their lives. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=590))
- Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=597))
    - ==Note: **Extremely important to close the loop**==
- As Peter Drucker wrote: “In knowledge work . . . the task is not given; it has to be determined. ‘What are the expected results from this work?’ is . . . the key question in making knowledge workers productive. And it is a question that demands risky decisions. There is usually no right answer; there are choices instead. And results have to be clearly specified, if productivity is to be achieved.”* ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=642))
    - ==Note: **#quote**==
- We need to transform all the “stuff” we’ve attracted and accumulated into a clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=685))
    - ==Note: **Todo lists cable meaningless, if they are just a list of “stuff”**==
- Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it substitutes for action. —Bill Raeder ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=699))
- lack of time is not the major issue for them (though they may think it is); the real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what associated next-action steps are required. Clarifying things on the front end, when they first appear on the radar, rather than on the back end, after trouble has developed, allows people to reap the benefits of managing action. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=730))
    - ==Note: **Lack of clarity is a bigger problem than lack of time**==
- Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what “done” means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action). ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=732))
    - ==Note: **Core of GTD is clarity**==
- You need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways—horizontally and vertically. Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=752))
- Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=760))
- There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=784))
- as soon as you have two things to do stored only in your mind, you’ve generated personal failure, because you can’t do them both at the same time. This produces a pervasive stress factor whose source can’t be pinpointed. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=809))
    - ==Note: **Not writing things down can compound stress**==
- We (1) capture what has our attention; (2) clarify what each item means and what to do about it; (3) organize the results, which presents the options we (4) reflect on, which we then choose to (5) engage with. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=833))
    - ==Note: **Five steps of GTD**==
- WORKFLOW DIAGRAM—CLARIFYING ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=992))
    - ==Note: **Workflow of GTD**==
- I define a project as any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step. This ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1044))
    - ==Note: **What is a project**==
- You don’t actually do a project; you can only do action steps related to it. When enough of the right action steps have been taken, some situation will have been created that matches your initial picture of the outcome closely enough that you can call it “done.” ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1065))
    - ==Note: **Tricky thing about projects is that you can’t do them in one go, you have to get a set of things done to get them done**==
- Support Materials and Reference Files Once you have organized your project support material by theme or topic, you will probably find that it is almost identical to your reference material and could be kept in the same reference file system ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1074))
- I usually recommend that people store their support materials out of sight. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1077))
## New highlights added July 30, 2023 at 12:23 PM
- Mind Over Water (Houghton Mifflin, 1998): Rowers have a word for this frictionless state: swing. . . . Recall the pure joy of riding on a backyard swing: an easy cycle of motion, the momentum coming from the swing itself. The swing carries us; we do not force it. We pump our legs to drive our arc higher, but gravity does most of the work. We are not so much swinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The shell wants to move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is simply to work with the shell, to stop holding it back with our thrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard sabotages boat speed. Trying becomes striving and striving undoes itself. Social climbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts prove them no such thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have already arrived. Swing is a state of arrival. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=556))
    - ==Note: **Great rowing quote on flow state**==
- It is better to be wrong than to be vague. —Freeman Dyson ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=979))
    - ==Note: **Importance of #clarity**==
- The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment At 3:22 on Wednesday, how do you choose what to do? At that moment there are four criteria you can apply, in this order: context, time available, energy available, and priority. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1257))
- there are three different kinds of activities you can be engaged in: Doing predefined work Doing work as it shows up Defining your work ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1275))
- Horizon 5: Purpose and principles Horizon 4: Vision Horizon 3: Goals Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities Horizon 1: Current projects Ground: Current actions ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1294))
    - ==Note: **The six level hierarchy for finding clarity**==
- Nothing Goes Back into “In” There’s a one-way path out of “in.” This is actually what was meant by the old admonition to “handle things once,” though handling things just once is in fact a bad idea. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=2608))
    - ==Note: **Must clean inbox**==
- Many years ago Alfred North Whitehead cogently observed, “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” Checklists provide the micro version of that macro observation: whenever you have to think about anything, either because of some regularity of a refreshed view (“At the end of every calendar year, I want/need to . . .”) or a specific situation that requires more detail than you can easily recall (“Before I deliver a seminar, I need to . . .”), you should entrust those jobs to your “external mind”—your management system that holds the details you need to engage with at appropriate times.* ([Location 3586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=3586))
    - ==Note: **Checklists are important for success**==
