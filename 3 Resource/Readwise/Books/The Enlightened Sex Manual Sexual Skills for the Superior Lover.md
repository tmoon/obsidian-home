## Highlights
- What do I want from my work, from my sexing, from my friends, from my family? What do I want altogether in my life, more than anything else?
  An ejaculation is not it. What I really want is a depth of openness far beyond the cycle of tension and release afforded by a genital spurt. I want to love so profoundly, relax so deeply, and abide so effortlessly in the freedom of open consciousness that I cease being afraid, unfulfilled, or separate at heart.
  My whole life revolves around this need. I am constantly seeking love, fulfillment, or freedom from stress and fear. Yet everything I do to alleviate my suffering and increase my happiness seems only to prolong the shallow torture. As I grow older, I find myself settling for familiar comforts. Seeking profound fulfillment seems futile. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4swac5bsbsg2wmghbej6hww))
- All seeking is resolved. I rest as the space that I am, as does my lover. Our sexual play continues, but now it echoes in a wall-less chamber of huge love. The craving that made me tense with ejaculative need dissolves spontaneously in the openness of being, who I am, who she is, rippling as this moment.

- All day, whenever you can remember to do so, it is helpful to practice receiving energy fully while inhaling deep into your belly, as well as releasing energy fully while exhaling upward along the spine. You can also practice contracting your pelvic floor periodically throughout the day. Then, when you are in the midst of sex, the basic circulation of breath and energy will already be in place.

- *Unless you deepen* *your capacity to love, the technical sexual practices will only make you* *into a non-ejaculatory robot of mechanical thrust and breath.*
  Practicing love often means feeling through fear: intentionally opening yourself when you would rather close down, giving yourself when you would rather hide. Love means recognizing yourself as the open fullness of this moment regardless of its contents - trenchant thoughts, enchanting pleasures, heavy emotions, or gnawing pains - and surrendering all hold on the familiar act you call "me."

- The superior lover is one who practices authentic loving in the form of his or her chosen lifestyle, rather than stopping short and building a comfortable cage of familiar habits inside the confines of fear. Enlightened sex involves technical exercises to retrain the body's energy, but primarily it is a matter of practicing love, feeling through the limits on love, and unguardedly being the vulnerable openness that is your true nature, over and over and over - during sex, with family, and at work - so the reflex of separation ceases to bind the heart to the familiar sense of stress that we call "me." Only the unguarded heart, relaxed as the whole of this moment, is willing to feel as the openness that consumes birth and death.

- For most men, becoming a superior lover involves retraining the addiction to ejaculation. When sex becomes an ecstatic and intensely pleasurable art of spiritual communion in love, then your ejaculation is naturally regulated by your breath and heart-feeling, rather than by your old habits of solitary fantasy and accumulated stress.
  If you want a deep life, deepen your sexual energy. To know and express your deep being, it's best to Curtail your spilling of attention into millimeter-deep puddles. Then you will have the strength necessary to penetrate through your old habits of body and mind, remaining vigilant and authentic to your deepest truth.

- Whereas most men lose energy when they ejaculate, many women find that when they have orgasms their energy actually increases and flows more freely helping their hearts to open more widely. However, just as men can learn to convert ejaculatory orgasms into internal rejuvenating orgasms, women can learn to bloom their orgasms into deeper and deeper openings of rejuvenating bliss.
