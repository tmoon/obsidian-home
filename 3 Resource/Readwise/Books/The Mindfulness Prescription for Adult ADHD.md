## Highlights
- Mindfulness helps us accept ourselves as we are right now and, paradoxically, through acceptance, leads to possibilities for growth and change. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=256))
    - ==Note: **Mindfulness requires self aceptance**==
- Studies conducted at academic centers around the world over the past several years are showing that after an eight-week training in mindfulness, different groups of people, ranging from medical students to patients with depression to elementary school children, show improvements in mental health symptoms and a greater sense of well-being.1 Studies in neuroscience, meanwhile, point to the ability of mental exercises such as mindfulness to enhance the brain circuits responsible for attention and emotion regulation.2 ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=263))
- My big epiphany came when I realized I could pay attention to my attention. I learned that I could observe my thoughts, feelings, or body responses in a new way, without being caught up in them or without wanting to change them. At my first weeklong meditation retreat, I experienced brief moments of observing my busy mind in an entirely different way—by witnessing it rather than being controlled by it. At one point, I noticed that upsetting feelings began bubbling up inside me, but rather than pushing them away or being completely overwhelmed, I chose to pay attention to how my body felt when I was really upset. That’s when I realized that my thoughts were often judgmental or unkind to myself or others, and I discovered that the introduction of gentleness and kindness allowed me to learn about the places where I was “stuck.” ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=274))
- Where we place our attention shapes our lives. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=328))

- While reasons for being scattered may be different, the antidote is learning to pause and shift your attention—this time in a purposeful way—to the present moment. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=939))
- Dr. Michael Posner at the University of Oregon, describes three attention networks: alerting, orienting, and conflict attention (also called executive attention).1 ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=949))
    - ==Note: **Three kind of attention network**==
- Alerting has to do with readying or gearing up attention to respond to experiences, and it also involves maintaining good alertness over time. Vigilance and alert arousal are related to this network. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=950))
- Orienting has to do with movement of attention toward a sensory stimulus or shifting attention from one thing to another. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=955))
- Conflict attention has to do with choosing and controlling responses, and it is involved in paying attention despite distractions. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=957))
- It’s often said that in ADHD the problem isn’t that a person isn’t able to pay attention, but that he or she isn’t able to pay attention to the right thing at the right time. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=980))
- Mindfulness involves both focusing and monitoring our attention. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=988))
    - ==Note: **Dropping into awareness**==
- five basic senses. 1.   Seeing 2.   Hearing 3.   Smelling 4.   Tasting 5.   Touching ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=1019))
- Mindfulness is about focusing our attention on the present moment and remembering to come back to the present moment when we become distracted. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=1101))
    - ==Note: **Begin again**==
- Formal Practices Mindful eating can be done as a formal practice. For this week, every day (or as many days as you can) eat an entire meal mindfully. Eat in silence, more slowly than usual, and notice all the sounds, tastes, smells, thoughts, and feelings that are present. If you eat most meals with your family, trying eating in silence for the first three to five minutes of the meal. With children, feel free to make it fun and playful. Mindful Awareness in Daily Life Do an “attention check-in,” setting an alarm or using a posted reminder sign. Notice what you’re attending to at that moment. Practice shifting your attention to your senses and the present moment. For example: °   See and touch your pet with a full awareness. °   Smell the soap and feel the water when taking a shower. °   Hear the sounds of traffic outside your window. °   Cook new foods. °   Do some gardening paying special attention to the sensations of touch and smell. °   Experience your partner through your senses.

- It’s often said that adults with ADHD know what to do—they just can’t get it done. Joan knows she needs to organize her desk, but she still procrastinates. Kirk knows he has too many projects, but he still starts a new one before completing the ones in progress. There’s a disconnection between understanding and action. ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=2533))
    - ==Note: **ADHD patients know what need to be done but can’t get done as they have hard time focusing on one item. Lesson: focus on one item at a time, finish it and then move on**==
- The three basic principles in using mindfulness with actions are: Pausing Practicing calm focus Mindful self-coaching ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=2552))
    - ==Note: **Three principles of using meditation**==
- Am I already doing something else? (Doing something that’s productive but not the task you planned on is a sneaky way to procrastinate.) ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=2567))
    - ==Note: **Doing productive, but low priority items is the hill to die—make sure you have a solid prioritization framework**==
- EXPLORATION 8.2 The Mountain Meditation ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085FGGMI&location=2583))
    - ==Note: **Imagine you being like a mountain, steady and still, also keep a photo of mountain on your work space**==
