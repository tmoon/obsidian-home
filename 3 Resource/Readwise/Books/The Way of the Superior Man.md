## Highlights
- Stop waiting. Feel everything. Love achingly. Give impeccably. Let go. Repeat with whatever remains, as long as you are moved to do so. This way dissolves wide open. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=158))
- To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of sexual passion and spiritual openness. Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity, which is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles. All natural forces flow between two poles. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=203))
    - ==Note: **Sexual energy requires a duality of poles to flow**==
- The bottom line of today’s newly emerging 50/50, or “second stage,” relationship is this: If men and women are clinging to a politically correct sameness even in moments of intimacy, then sexual attraction disappears. I don’t mean just the desire for intercourse, but the juice of the entire relationship begins to dry up. The love may still be strong, the friendship may still be strong, but the sexual polarity fades, unless in moments of intimacy one partner is willing to play the masculine pole and one partner is willing to play the feminine. You have to animate the masculine and feminine differences if you want to play in the field of sexual passion. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=214))
- The masculine error is to think that eventually things will be different in some fundamental way. They won’t. It never ends. As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=328))
    - ==Note: **Present is all we have, stop waiting**==
- The world and your woman will always present you with unforeseen challenges. You are either living fully, giving your gift in the midst of those challenges, even today, or you are waiting for an imaginary future which will never come. Men who have lived significant lives are men who never waited: not for money, security, ease, or women. Feel what you want to give most as a gift, to your woman and to the world, and do what you can to give it today. Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=351))
    - ==Note: **Don’t wait, carpe diem**==
- Your fear is the sharpest definition of your self. You should know it. You should feel it virtually constantly. Fear needs to become your friend, so that you are no longer uncomfortable with it. Rather, primary fear shows you that you are at your edge. Staying with the fear, staying at your edge, allows real transformation to occur. Neither lazy nor aggressive, playing your edge allows you to perceive the moment with the least amount of distortion. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=500))
    - ==Note: **There is an optimal level of stress (or rather strain) that results in incredible results**==
- Own your fear, and lean just beyond it. In every aspect of your life. Starting now. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=511))
    - ==Note: **Lean just a bit beyond your fear**==
- The superior man is not seeking for fulfillment through work and woman, because he is already full. For him, work and intimacy are opportunities to give his gifts, and be vanished in the bliss of the giving. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=608))
    - ==Note: **Be full from purpose, not from work or woman**==
- Only the masculine side of your woman will grow through challenge. The feminine side thrives on support and praise. Telling her, “I love the shape of your body,” will be much greater incentive for her to exercise than telling her, “I hope you don’t gain any more weight.” Praise always magnifies the quality of your woman that you praise. “You’re so beautiful when you smile,” is much more effective than, “You’re so ugly when you frown,” although they both indicate your desire for her smile. When speaking to your woman, it is always better to call the glass half full than half empty. Praise is literal food for feminine qualities. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=890))
    - ==Note: **Women grow in praise, whereas men grow in adversities and challenges**==
