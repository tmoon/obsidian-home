## Highlights
- Using AI to Enhance Human Capabilities: Exploring Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics
  Key takeaways:
  - The symbiosis between a person and an anti-aircraft gun was an early example of cybernetics.
  - Authors propose that we should aim for symbiosis instead of replacing people with technology.

  Where they're trying to build these systems where the human is aiming the anti-aircraft gun and there's a feedback loop or the anti-aircraft gun is giving feedback to the human to help them be more accurate as they aim at the Extender capabilities to lead these planes or predict where they're going and that that symbiosis between the person and the anti-aircraft gun was an early example of cybernetics and so these authors are saying that's what we need not replacing people with technology ([Time 0:06:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e4f27697-1a8b-4c65-9803-13665e26d320))

- Cybernetic Productivity: Speeding Up Work and Keeping Information Accessible
  Key takeaways:
  - Automation and speeding up work are important in cybernetic productivity.
  - Keeping needed information easily accessible is crucial in cybernetic productivity.
  - Tools like Google and Gmail implement the principle of easily accessible information.
  - Moving away from outdated methods of accessing information is necessary for effective knowledge work.

  Four principles three that are have been around for the last 20 years and one that's become more popular in recent years So the first principle of cybernetic productivity is that you should attempt to automate or speed up shallow tasks as much as possible ([Time 0:08:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7dc59990-65a4-479d-bcab-b38d66b38dbf))
