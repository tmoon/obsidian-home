# Resources - Knowledge Library Organized by Theme

> **Function:** Reference material you want to keep, organized by topic not source.

---

## What Lives Here

**3 Core MOCs** → Maps of Content organized by theme
- Productivity Systems MOC (GTD, BASB, Deep Work, time management)
- Health Optimization MOC (fitness, nutrition, sleep, ADHD, supplements)
- AI Tools & Prompts MOC (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, SignalPilot workflows)

**Readwise Imports** → Automated highlights and notes
- Books, articles, podcasts
- Synced automatically from Readwise
- Leave this folder as-is (it's auto-populated)

**Cool LLM Prompts** → Your AI productivity library
- Reusable prompts that work
- Design doc templates
- Strategic thinking frameworks

**Long Term Thoughts** → Strategic explorations
- Big ideas that need time to develop
- Moved from Areas (not requiring monthly maintenance)

**Entertainment** → Media and cultural consumption
- Moved from Areas (recreational, not responsibility)

## Key Difference: Topic vs Source

**Bad organization:** By where it came from
- Books folder, Articles folder, Podcasts folder
- Have to search multiple places for one topic

**Good organization:** By what it's about
- All productivity notes in one MOC
- All health notes in one MOC
- All AI notes in one MOC

**Your system does BOTH:**
- Readwise organized by source (automated, don't change)
- MOCs organized by topic (your access layer)
- MOCs link TO Readwise notes via Dataview queries

---

## MOC Usage

**When to use:**
- Need all notes on a topic fast
- Want to discover connections
- Building expertise in an area

**How MOCs work:**
- Auto-populate via Dataview queries
- Search content for keywords
- Show all related notes in one view

**Monthly review:**
- Check each MOC for new insights
- Practice progressive summarization:
  - First read: Bold key passages
  - Second read: Highlight the best bold
  - Third read: Add executive summary at top

---

## Rules

**Add Resources:**
- Content from Readwise → stays in Readwise folder (automatic)
- Your own notes → create directly in Resources root or subfolder
- Tag appropriately so MOCs can find them

**Keep vs Delete:**
- If you'll reference it again → Keep in Resources
- If it's outdated → Archive
- If it's actionable now → Move to Projects or Areas
- If you're just hoarding → Delete

**Never:**
- Don't reorganize Readwise folder (it's auto-synced)
- Don't duplicate notes between MOCs (let Dataview link them)
- Don't create MOCs with <10 notes (too early)

---

## Progressive Summarization

**Your competitive advantage as a CEO: Extract value fast.**

When you revisit a Resource note:

**First pass:** Bold 10-20% (key sentences)
**Second pass:** Highlight best bold passages
**Third pass:** Add 3-sentence summary at top

**Goal:** Get the insight in 30 seconds on future reads.

Most people read once and forget. You're extracting compound value.

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**This folder is your external brain for knowledge. Make it work for you.**

You have Readwise imports - good. But they're useless unless distilled. Next time you re-read a note, bold the best parts. Do that 3 times and you have a knowledge asset.

The 3 MOCs organize your most important topics:
- **Productivity** → How you work
- **Health** → Your energy source
- **AI** → Your leverage multiplier (especially for SignalPilot)

Review these monthly. Add new content. Discover connections. This is where strategic insights come from.

**Resources organized by topic > Resources organized by source. Always.**

*Your knowledge library is only valuable if you can access insights fast.*
