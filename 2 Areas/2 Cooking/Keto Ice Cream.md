### July 13 Recipe
8 servings


8tbsp cream: half cup
1 cup greek yoghurt
1 cup cottage cheese
3 cup evaporated milk

1 tsp xanthum gum + 1 tsp guar gum

.5tsp salt

12 scoop vanilla whey protein
8 tbsp powder milk
5cup milk

4.5 cup fruit


So coz I generally prepare bulk my process is a bit more involved:

1. whip the cream in blender and then mix in yoghurt

2. In a separate pot add milk, sweetener and warm it to around 200f. I add 1tbsp corn starch diluted in cold milk and make a custard like thing by stirring constantly for 5mins

3. I add rest of the ingredients and milk into cream yoghurt mixture
#### Observations:
1. The fruit mix was too thick (consider lowering gum slightly)
2. Also, 6 servings or smaller and 2+ flavors are the best as it does not fill up the blender
