Once online, you can find a **User Guide For Residents** in the online library, under the section titled "Community Help".  
  
**IMPORTANT**: The Board/Management also have the capability in MMN to place voice call blasts. When this capability is used, the MMN platform will call you at the telephone number in your profile to inform you about the reason for the call via recorded message (such as important reminders, alerts, emergencies, etc.). The calls will come from the telephone number **(787) 305-3057**. As such, please take whatever steps are needed to ensure that calls from this telephone number are not blocked.
