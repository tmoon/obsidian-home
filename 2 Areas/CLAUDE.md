# Areas - Ongoing Responsibilities & Standards

> **Function:** Life domains requiring continuous attention and maintenance, never "done."

---

## What Makes an Area

**Ongoing Responsibility** → No completion state
- "Maintain health" yes, "Run marathon" no (that's a Project)
- Standard to uphold, not goal to achieve
- Requires monthly attention minimum

**Sphere of Activity** → Distinct domain of your life
- Work, health, finances, relationships, etc.
- Each area has its own standards
- Neglect one, and it degrades over time

**Not a Project** → Never finishes
- Projects have end states, Areas don't
- Projects happen WITHIN Areas
- Example: "Launch SignalPilot" (Project) happens in "Work" (Area)

## Your 8 Active Areas

1. **Health & Wealth** → Physical wellbeing + financial security
2. **Productivity** → Systems and workflows
3. **Reading** → Learning and knowledge intake
4. **Cooking** → Nutrition and culinary exploration
5. **Organization** → Personal systems and order
6. **Taxes** → Tax strategy and compliance (PR Act 60 + Personal)
7. **Travel** → Experiences and exploration
8. **Houses & Real Estate** → Property management (most active!)

**Why 8?** BASB recommends 7-10 max. More than that dilutes focus.

## Rules

**Weekly Focus:**
- Pick 3 Areas needing attention this week
- Ignore the other 5 (they're fine for now)
- Rotate focus based on what needs care

**Monthly Review:**
- Check health of each Area
- Any neglected >60 days? Address or archive
- Standards slipping? Create project to fix

**Archive When:**
- No longer a responsibility (e.g., sold house)
- Can merge with another Area
- No activity 60+ days despite being important

## Area vs Project Decision

**Ask:** "Will this ever be done?"

- **Yes** → It's a Project (goes in Projects folder)
- **No** → It's an Area (lives here)

**Example:**
- "Health & Wealth" Area → ongoing responsibility
- "Run marathon in <4hrs" Project → happens within Health Area
- "Hit $1M ARR" Project → happens within Work/Company Area

## Area Health Metrics

**Healthy Area:**
- ✅ Reviewed monthly
- ✅ Clear standards in place
- ✅ Has active project when needed
- ✅ Not causing stress

**Unhealthy Area:**
- 🔴 Neglected >90 days
- 🔴 No clear standards
- 🔴 Constant firefighting
- 🔴 Creating anxiety

**If Unhealthy:** Create a project to stabilize it, or archive if no longer relevant.

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**Areas are where you maintain standards. Projects are where you raise them.**

You can't actively develop 8 Areas at once. Pick 3 to focus on each week. The rest? Maintain minimum standards, don't try to optimize.

Your "Houses & Real Estate" Area is most active (8 tasks in inbox). That's fine - it needs attention. But it shouldn't monopolize your week. Time-box it.

**Founder trap:** Neglecting Health & Wealth while building company. Then burning out. Don't.

Every world-class CEO has non-negotiables in Health (sleep, exercise, nutrition). Build yours.

**This week, which 3 Areas need your attention?**
