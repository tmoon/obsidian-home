**Daily rituals are important part of the day and key cornerstone of [[Atomic Habit]] formation**

## Division of a Day
Divide the day into 3 parts
1. Morning rituals and prep: goal is to set the right intention and plan the day
2. Work Block: get shit done, complete focus. Try to maximize time spent on urgent work
3. Evening activities: mix of fun, hobbies, relationships, learning

## Rituals By Division of a Day
#todo add descriptions and philosophy behind the rituals
