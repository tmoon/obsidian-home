### Priorities:
1. Simple and lowest friction way to write things down
2. Good search
3. Easy to write and organize thoughrs 
4. Good sync across iPhone, iPad and Mac

### Good to have
1. Good Apple Pencil support 
2. Sharing (although this is not meant to be a multiplayer thing)
3. Chatgpt support 

### Lessons from the book:
1. CODE = Capture -> Organize -> Distill -> Express
2. PARA  = Project + Area + Resource + Archive

### Notetaking options:
1. **Apple Note**
	1. Very simple, fast, and almost no friction
	2. ~~Lacks a lot of the features (but simplicity might be worth the tradeoff)~~
	3. Apple Pencil support for rough brainstorming (big plus)
	4. Can link my local folders to keep track of other resources
	5. Search from the spotlight (not sure if as important)
	6. No folding support, not great for large amount of info
	7. No support for readwise
2. **Notion**
	1. Very good db systems support that can help to organize tasks tremendously 
	2. Slow, and not accessible offline
	3. search not as fast as either of these two
	4. Readwise support for syncing notes from consumer contents for review later
	5. ~~Much better *multiplayer* support which I dont really need for knowledge storing~~
3. **Obsidian**
	1. While no db system, it has very good back linking and lot of support for PKM 
	2. Relatively fast and accessible offline 
	4. relatively low friction
	5. Readwise support for syncing notes from consumer contents for review later
	6. ~~GPT support + knowledge graph ~~
	7. ~~can't share easily and no multiplayer support~~
	8. Folding support allows to put large amount of info together
