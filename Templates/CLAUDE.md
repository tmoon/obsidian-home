## Why Templates Matter

**Decision Fatigue Is Real**

Every time you create a new note, you make micro-decisions:
- What structure should this have?
- What fields do I need?
- How do I organize this?

**Templates eliminate these decisions.**

You use mental energy for CONTENT, not STRUCTURE.

## Template Philosophy

**Good Template:**
- Forces important thinking (Goals before Tasks)
- Consistent structure across all similar items
- Includes automation hooks (YAML for Dataview)
- Minimal friction to use

**Bad Template:**
- Too complex, rarely used
- Missing key sections
- No clear purpose
- Over-engineered

**Your templates are good.** They're focused, actionable, automatable.

## How to Use

**Creating New Project:**
1. Use Project Template
2. Fill Goals + Deliverables BEFORE tasks
3. Ask: "What will I ship?"
4. Break tasks into <2min steps

**Sunday Weekly Review:**
1. Use Weekly Review Template
2. Follow time boxes religiously (prevents overthinking)
3. Goal: Inbox zero, 1-3 focus projects, 5-7 scheduled tasks

**Daily Planning:**
1. Use Day Planner Template for new days
2. Time block your day (don't just list tasks)
3. Pick ONE "eat the frog" for 7:30 AM
4. Sunday: Do weekly review section first

## Template Maintenance

**Quarterly:**
- Review each template
- Is it still serving you?
- Any sections never used? Delete them
- Any missing sections? Add them

**When to Create New Template:**
- You're creating the same structure 3+ times
- Consistency matters for this type of note
- Automation requires standardized YAML

**When NOT to:**
- One-off notes (use Generic Idea Template or nothing)
- Over-engineering (simpler = better)

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**Templates are leverage. They let you focus on thinking, not formatting.**

Your Project Template forcing "Deliverables" section is genius. It makes you ask: "What am I shipping?" before you start doing tasks. Most founders skip this and stay busy without shipping.

The Weekly Review Template is non-negotiable. Use it EVERY Sunday. Follow the time boxes. This 30 minutes maintains the entire system.

Day Planner Template with weekly review prompt means you can't miss it on Sundays. It's built into the flow.

**Systems > Discipline:** Good templates make the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard.

**Use your templates. Don't fight them. They're your consistency engine.**
