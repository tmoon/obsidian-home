# Projects - Finite Goals with Deliverables

> **Function:** Active initiatives that have a clear end state and produce shareable outcomes.

---

## Folder Structure

**0 Running Projects** → This week's focus (1-3 max)
- Projects you're actively executing on THIS week
- Review daily, should see progress every day
- Move to Archive when complete

**1 Next Projects** → Queued for next 1-2 weeks
- Projects starting within 1-2 weeks
- Not "someday" but not "today"
- Review during weekly review, promote to Running when ready

**Someday Tasks** → Parking lot for later
- Ideas and projects for next month or beyond
- Review monthly, promote if relevant 3+ times
- Delete ruthlessly if stale 6+ months

## What Makes a Project

**Finite Goal** → Has a completion state
- Not ongoing like "maintain health" (that's an Area)
- Has a clear "done" moment
- Example: "Launch SignalPilot MVP" not "Build company"

**Deliverable Focus** → Produces intermediate packets
- Design mockup, draft document, shipped feature
- Something you can share/show others
- Tangible output, not just completed tasks

**Time-Bounded** → Reviewed weekly, archived if stale
- If no activity 14+ days → Archive or recommit
- Active projects require weekly attention
- Stale projects = decision debt

## Project Structure

Every project file has:

**Goals** → What success looks like
- Clear, specific, measurable
- Aligned with company vision (SignalPilot growth)

**Deliverables** → What you'll ship
- Intermediate packets (shareable assets)
- Not tasks - actual outputs
- Example: "Pitch deck" not "write slides"

**Outcomes** → Desired impact
- Why this project matters
- What changes when it's done

**Tasks** → Atomic action steps
- Break into <2min steps
- Specific, actionable, no ambiguity
- "Email John re: pricing" not "follow up"

**Completed** → Done tasks archive here
- Celebrate wins
- See progress accumulate

## Rules

**Add Projects:**
- Use Project Template (in Templates folder)
- Fill out Goals + Deliverables BEFORE tasks
- Ask: "What will I ship?"

**Review Weekly:**
- Every Sunday during weekly review
- Still relevant? Keep
- No progress 14+ days? Archive or delete
- Pick 1-3 FOCUS projects for next week

**Archive When:**
- Completed successfully
- No longer aligned with goals
- Stale 30+ days with no activity
- Replaced by better opportunity

---

## Current Project Limit

**MAX 5 active projects. Ideal: 1-3.**

If you have >5 projects:
- You don't have projects, you have wishes
- Archive everything not moving the needle THIS week
- Pick 1-3 that matter most
- Say no to the rest

---

## Flow Between Folders

**Someday → Next → Running → Archive**

1. **Capture** in Someday Tasks (during weekly review or braindump processing)
2. **Promote** to Next Projects when relevant within 1-2 weeks
3. **Activate** to Running Projects when starting this week
4. **Complete** and move to Archive when done

**Key decision points:**
- Someday → Next: "Will I start this within 1-2 weeks?"
- Next → Running: "Am I starting this THIS week?"
- Running → Archive: "Is this complete or no longer relevant?"

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**Projects are where execution happens. This folder should be LEAN.**

If you're juggling >3 active projects, you're context-switching yourself to death. Pick ONE primary project, 1-2 secondary. Archive the rest.

Every project should answer: "What will I ship this week?" If the answer is "I don't know" or "just tasks," you need clearer deliverables.

The best founders ship constantly. Small deliverables compound. A shipped mockup beats a perfect plan.

**What's your ONE project moving SignalPilot forward this week?**

*Projects = Execution engine. Keep it lean, keep it shipping.*
