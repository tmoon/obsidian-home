## Review Schedule

**Monthly Review (First Sunday):**
- Review this list during your monthly review
- Promote items that become relevant to active projects
- Delete items that no longer resonate
- Add new someday ideas from your weekly reviews

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this still interesting to me?
- Has the context changed (making this more/less relevant)?
- Should this become an active project?
- Can I delegate or delete this?

---

## Notes

- **This is NOT an active project list** - these are intentionally on hold
- **Don't feel guilty** about items here - they're meant to wait
- **Prune ruthlessly** - if it's been here 6+ months with no movement, delete it
- **One rule**: If you think about it 3+ times, promote it to active project
