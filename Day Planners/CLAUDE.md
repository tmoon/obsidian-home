## Sunday Special: Weekly Review

**First thing on Sunday planner:**
- Prominent weekly review prompt appears at top
- Do this BEFORE daily planning
- 30 minutes, time-boxed, non-negotiable

**Why Sunday:**
- Sets up entire week
- Mental clarity before Monday
- Strategic thinking when rested

**Use:** Weekly Review Template in Templates folder

## Time Blocking Principles

**Energy > Time**
- 7:30-9:30 AM: Peak cognitive (strategic, creative work)
- 10:00-12:00: Focused execution
- 13:00-14:00: Admin, meetings, lower-stakes work
- 15:00-17:00: Second wind (tactical execution)
- 19:00+: Review, plan, wind down

**Protect the Frog Time (7:30 AM)**
- No meetings, no email, no Slack
- This is YOUR time for strategic work
- SignalPilot design, investor thinking, product strategy
- 2 hours here > 8 hours scattered throughout day

**Calendar Integration**
- Google Calendar auto-populates today + tomorrow
- Shows commitments you can't move
- Plan deep work around fixed commitments

---

## Archival System

**Weekly During Review:**
- Archive planners older than 7 days
- Move to Archive/Day Planner Archive/
- Keeps this folder clean
- Searchable history maintained

**Why Archive:**
- Execution history (proof of work)
- Pattern recognition (what actually works)
- Time audit (where does time go)
- Learning material (iterate on schedule)

## Your Chief of Staff Says

**This is your execution layer. Planning without daily execution = wishful thinking.**

Your Day Planners turn strategy into action. Projects are what you ship. Day Planners are how you ship them.

**The 7:30 "Eat the Frog" time is sacred.**

Most CEOs let their calendar own them. Meetings at 9 AM, reactive all day, exhausted by evening. You're doing opposite:

- 7:30 AM: Strategic work when sharp
- Meetings later when you can afford distraction
- Evening: Reflect and plan, not execute

This is how world-class founders operate.

**Time blocking > To-do lists**

A task on a list is a wish. A task in a time block is a commitment.

Block time for your "eat the frog" task FIRST, then fit everything else around it.

**Sunday weekly review appears in your planner.** You can't miss it. Do it. This 30 minutes maintains your entire system.

**Daily execution compounds. Show up 7:30 AM, eat the frog, repeat. That's how SignalPilot gets built.**
